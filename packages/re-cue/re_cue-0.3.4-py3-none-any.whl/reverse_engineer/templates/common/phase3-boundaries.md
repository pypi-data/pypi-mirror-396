# Phase 3: System Boundary Mapping
## {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Generated**: {{DATE}}
**Analysis Phase**: 3 of 4 - System Boundary Mapping

---

## Overview

This document contains the results of Phase 3 analysis: mapping system boundaries,
subsystems, layers, and component interactions.

- **System Boundaries**: {{BOUNDARY_COUNT}}
- **Subsystems**: {{SUBSYSTEM_COUNT}}
- **Layers**: {{LAYER_COUNT}}
- **Components**: {{COMPONENT_COUNT}}

## Next Steps

After reviewing the boundary mapping:

1. **Proceed to Phase 4**: Use Case Extraction
   - Identify use cases from actor-boundary interactions
   - Extract business processes
   - Document scenarios and workflows

2. **Command to continue**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m reverse_engineer --phase 4 --path {{PROJECT_PATH}}
   ```
