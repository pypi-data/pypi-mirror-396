# PageLeaf

🌿 **PageLeaf** is a personal paper-reading assistant for researchers and developers.

It helps you understand papers deeply, record your own research judgments, and build a small, curated paper library over time.

PageLeaf is designed for people who actually read papers — not just skim summaries.

---

## Core Principles

* **Small & curated**: 
  Your paper library stays intentionally small (hundreds or thousands, not millions).
* **Judgment over summary**: 
  AI-generated content supports reading, but your own judgments matter more.
* **Local-first**: 
  Papers, notes, and metadata are stored locally.
* **Paper → Thinking → Network**: 
  Papers connect through ideas, not just citations.
