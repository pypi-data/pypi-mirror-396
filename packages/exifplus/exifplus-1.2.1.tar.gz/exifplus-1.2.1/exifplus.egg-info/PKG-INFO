## **ReadMe & Instruction Manual**

### **ExifPlus - Metadata Viewer and Editor**

#### **Overview**

ExifPlus is a modern and intuitive tool designed for managing metadata in image and video files. Whether you're a photographer looking to adjust your photo's metadata or a content creator dealing with video files, ExifPlus offers powerful features to read and modify various types of metadata like EXIF, IPTC, and XMP.

### **Key Features**

* **Read and Edit EXIF, IPTC, XMP and other metadata** from images and videos. (Right Now Windows doesnt support Edit mode, also doesnt Supports IPTC and XMP.)
* **User-friendly GUI** built with `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap` for a sleek and responsive interface.
* **Supports multiple media formats** including `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tiff`, `.heic`, `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, and `.mkv`.
* **Batch processing** to edit metadata across multiple files (future versions).
* **Save changes to metadata** and overwrite the original file.
* **Context Menu** with an option to delete rows of metadata for easy data management, or add new rows.
* **Export** the data as CSV or JSON
* **Open From URL or Local File** Now you can directly upload images from URL or still choose your Local File
* **Generate Reports** that are formatted in HTML and ready for submission to platforms such as Bugcrowd or HackerOne.
* **Cross-platform** support (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### **Installation**

You can install ExifPlus directly from **PyPI** using `pip`. To install the package, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install exifplus
```

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed for full functionality:

* `pyexiv2` (for metadata extraction and editing)
* `hachoir` (for reading video metadata)
* `ttkbootstrap` (for the GUI)

```bash
pip install pyexiv2 hachoir ttkbootstrap
```

### **Usage**

1. **Launch ExifPlus:**
   After installation, you can run ExifPlus directly from the command line (or from your Python script).

   ```bash
   python -m exifplus
   ```

   This will open the ExifPlus GUI, where you can load your files and begin editing metadata.

2. **Open (Local file / From URL)**
   Click the **Open** button to load an image or video. When you click **Open** a small dialog appears letting you choose one of two options:
   * **Local File** — choose a single image or video file from your computer.
   * **From URL** — paste a public image/video URL and ExifPlus will download and open it for inspection.

   **Supported formats**
   
   * **Images:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.tiff`, `.heic`
   * **Videos:** `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`
   
   **Notes & troubleshooting**
   
   * **403 / hotlinking:** Some sites block programmatic downloads (hotlink protection or CDN rules). If a URL download is blocked ExifPlus will prompt you to open the image in your browser so you can save it manually.
   * **No EXIF on hosted/resized images:** Services like Blogger/Google often strip EXIF metadata when resizing or serving images. If a URL opens but shows no metadata, try using the original/original-size file you uploaded instead of a CDN/resized copy.
   * **Windows users:** In-place writing of metadata may be limited on Windows (some native libraries are unstable). Use the **Export → JSON/CSV** feature to save metadata, or run on Linux/macOS for full read/write support.

3. **View and Edit Metadata:**
   Once the file is loaded, the metadata will be displayed in a table format with columns for the metadata **Key** and **Value**. You can:

   * **Double-click** a cell to edit its value.
   * **Right-click** to bring up a context menu with options like deleting the metadata row.

4. **Save Metadata:**
   After editing metadata, click the "Save Metadata" button to save your changes. The metadata will be saved back to the file.

5. **Delete Metadata Row:**
   To delete a specific metadata entry, right-click on a row and select "Delete Row". A confirmation dialog will appear to ensure you want to proceed with the deletion.

6. **Generate Report (HTML)**
   Click the **Generate Report** button to create a clean, professional **HTML metadata report**, ideal for:
   * Bugcrowd submissions
   * HackerOne reports
   * Security audits
   * Forensic analysis
   * Documentation

   The generated HTML report includes:

   * **Side-by-side image preview and metadata table**
   * Clean markup that can be viewed in any browser
   * Easily attachable as a file or screenshot
   * Automatically extracted EXIF, IPTC, XMP, and video/image metadata

   This feature makes it extremely easy to share metadata findings professionally.

7. **About Window:**
   Click on the "About" button to view information about the tool and the author.

### **Troubleshooting**

* **Error: `pyexiv2` is missing or fails to load**:
  Make sure you've installed the necessary dependencies. You may need to install system packages for `pyexiv2` to work properly on some systems (Linux or macOS). Refer to the `pyexiv2` documentation for installation instructions.

* **Error: `Invalid metadata key`**:
  When trying to modify metadata, ensure that the key you're trying to modify exists in the original file. You can view all the available keys in the table after loading a file.
