    Instantiating a scene (either of type `Scene` or subclass of `Scene`),
    will set that new scene instance to the current scene.

    Example:

    Structure of a scene and how to declare:

    ```python
    from charz_core import Scene
    from .my_files.player import Player

    class InsideHouse(Scene):
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            self.player = Player(position=Vec2(5, 7))  # Player when inside house
            self.table = ...
            self.chair = ...
    ```

    `NOTE` Use the *classmethod* `preload` to prevent setting current scene,
    while still loading nodes (and more) of the returned instance.

    When a node is created, it will be handled by the currently active `Scene`.

    `NOTE` If no `Scene` is created,
    a default `Scene` will be created and set as the active one.

    By subclassing `Scene`, and implementing `__init__`, all nodes
    created in that `__init__` will be added to that subclass's group of nodes.

    `NOTE (Technical)` A `Scene` hitting reference count of `0`
    will reduce the reference count to its nodes by `1`.
