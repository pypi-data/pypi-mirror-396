    All nodes existing in a scene (either "physically" or "theoretically"),
    will be instances of either this class, or a subclass.
    Subclasses can be combined with component mixins, using Python's multiple inheritance.
    This class can be instantiated directly, but in itself it does not do anything useful.

    The reference of nodes is stored in `Scene.groups[Group.NODE]`,
    which is a dictionary mapping `NodeID` to `Node` instances.
    It keeps the node alive, and prevents it from being garbage collected.

    Example:

    Every node will be assigned a unique identifier (`uid`),
    which can be used to reference it within the scene:

    ```python
    from charz_core import Scene, Node, Group

    my_node = Node()
    reference = Scene.groups[Group.NODE][my_node.uid]
    assert reference is my_node
    ```

    The assignment of `uid` is done automatically when the node is created,
    and is guaranteed to be unique within the scene.
    It happens at the end of the `__new__` chain.
    The `__new__` chain is when components call `super().__new__(...)`,
    which calls `Node.__new__` to assign the `uid`, since the bases are
    sorted to ensure `Node` is the last base in the MRO (Method Resolution Order).
