DockAI State Management.

This module defines the state structures used by the LangGraph workflow.
The state acts as the shared memory for the agent, persisting data across
different nodes (steps) of the execution graph. It includes not just the
current artifacts (like the Dockerfile) but also the agent's "memory" of
past attempts, plans, and reflections.

    This structure allows the agent to build a history of what has been tried,
    why it failed, and what was learned. This "episodic memory" is crucial
