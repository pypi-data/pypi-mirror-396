        Uploads an externally generated invoice PDF file for an invoice that is in Draft or Posted status. To use this operation, you must enable the Modify Invoice permission. See [Billing Permissions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information. This operation has the following restrictions: - Only the PDF file format is supported. - The maximum size of the PDF file to upload is 4 MB. - A maximum of 50 PDF files can be uploaded for one invoice.

        **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.  Writes off a posted invoice.   By writing off an invoice, a credit memo is created and applied to the invoice. The generated credit memo items and credit memo taxation items are applied to invoice items and invoice taxation items based on the configured default application rule. If an invoice is written off, the balance of each invoice item and invoice taxation item must be zero.  If you set the **Create credit memos mirroring invoice items billing rule** to **Yes**, you can write off an invoice even if all its items have zero balance.  **Restrictions**: You cannot write off an invoice if any of the following restrictions is met: * The balance of an invoice has been changed before Invoice Settlement is enabled.   For example, before Invoice Settlement is enabled, any credit balance adjustments, invoice item adjustments, or invoice adjustments have been applied to an invoice. * An invoice contains more than 2,000 items in total, including invoice items, discount items, and taxation items.
