With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  
        :type idempotency_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str
        :param content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
        :type content_encoding: str
        :param authorization: The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
        :type authorization: str
        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :type zuora_track_id: str
        :param zuora_entity_ids: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
        :type zuora_entity_ids: str
        :param zuora_version: The minor version of the Zuora REST API.  
        :type zuora_version: str
        :param zuora_org_ids: Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 
        :type zuora_org_ids: str
        :param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                                 number provided, it will be total request
                                 timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                                 (connection, read) timeouts.
        :type _request_timeout: int, tuple(int, int), optional
        :param _request_auth: set to override the auth_settings for an a single
                              request; this effectively ignores the
                              authentication in the spec for a single request.
        :type _request_auth: dict, optional
        :param _content_type: force content-type for the request.
        :type _content_type: str, Optional
        :param _headers: set to override the headers for a single
                         request; this effectively ignores the headers
                         in the spec for a single request.
        :type _headers: dict, optional
        :param _host_index: set to override the host_index for a single
                            request; this effectively ignores the host_index
                            in the spec for a single request.
        :type _host_index: int, optional
        :return: Returns the result object.
