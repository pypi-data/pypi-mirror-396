Cancel a journal run

This reference describes how to cancel a journal run using the REST API.            The summary journal entries in the journal run are canceled asynchronously. See the \"Example\" section below for details.            You must have the \"Cancel Journal Run\" Zuora Finance user permission enabled to cancel journal runs.  ### Notes When you cancel a journal run, the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled asynchronously. A response of `{ \"success\": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of \"Pending\", \"Error\", or \"Completed\" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled. nFor example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is \"Completed\" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to \"Yes\", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows: 1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run. 2. The journal run status is \"Completed\", so you receive a response of `{ \"success\": true }`. 3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is \"Yes\" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled. 4. The journal run status remains as \"Completed\". The status does not change to \"Canceled\" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

# satisfies your auth use case.

It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)

    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in.

If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] 
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional]

Retrieve a journal run

This REST API reference describes how to get information about a journal run. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.get_journal_run_response import GetJournalRunResponse
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.JournalRunsApi(api_client)
    jr_number = 'jr_number_example' # str | Journal run number. Must be a valid journal run number in the format `JR-00000001`.
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional)
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

    try:
        # Retrieve a journal run
        api_response = api_instance.get_journal_run(jr_number, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)
        print("The response of JournalRunsApi->get_journal_run:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling JournalRunsApi->get_journal_run: %s\n" % e)
```
