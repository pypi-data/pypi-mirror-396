Apply a payment

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Applies an unapplied payment to invoices and debit memos.  When you apply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to must be less than or equal to 15,000.          If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions: - If you want to apply one payment to multiple invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to apply one payment to a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.  For more information, see [Apply Unapplied Payments to Invoices and Debit Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Apply_Unapplied_Payments_to_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).

Create a payment

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Creates a payment in the following scenarios:  - A full or partial payment on an invoice or a debit memo - A full or partial payment on several invoices and debit memos - An unapplied payment in the following situations:   - You do not know which customer account the payment belongs to.   - You know which customer account the payment belongs to, but you do not know which invoice the payment is applied to.   - You receive a payment from your customer that exceeds the balance on the invoice.   - You receive a payment from your customer before the invoice has been created.   - You intend to create a payment without any invoices or debit memos. - A standalone payment. If you only need to create and process an electronic payment in Zuora through a Zuora gateway integration but settle the payment outside of Zuora, you can create a standalone payment. For a standalone payment, you can specify a currency different from the payment currency in the customer account settings.     The support for standalone payments is in the Early Adopter phase. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.   If you do not know to which customer account the payment belongs, you can create a payment without specifying a customer account. nWhen you create a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to should be less than or equal to 15,000. nFor more information, see [Create Payments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments) and [Create Payments Without Specifying Customer Accounts](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments_Without_Specifying_Customer_Accounts).

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **body** | [**CreatePaymentRequest**](CreatePaymentRequest.md)|  | 
 **idempotency_key** | **str**| Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   | [optional] 
 **accept_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] 
 **content_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] 
 **authorization** | **str**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] 
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional]

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **part_id** | **str**| The unique ID of a specific payment part. You can get the payment part ID from the response of [List all parts of a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Get_PaymentParts). | 
 **payment_key** | **str**| The unique ID or number of an unapplied payment. For example, &#x60;8a8082e65b27f6c3015b89e4344c16b1&#x60;, or &#x60;P-00000001&#x60;. | 
 **accept_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] 
 **content_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] 
 **authorization** | **str**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **page** | **int**| The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on &#x60;pageSize&#x60;. You must set &#x60;pageSize&#x60; before specifying &#x60;page&#x60;. For example, if you set &#x60;pageSize&#x60; to &#x60;20&#x60; and &#x60;page&#x60; to &#x60;2&#x60;, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response.  | [optional] [default to 1]
 **page_size** | **int**| The number of records returned per page in the response.  | [optional] [default to 20]
 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] 
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional]

List payments

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Retrieves the information about all payments from all your customer accounts.  ### Filtering  You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body.  If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.  Examples:  - /v1/payments?status=Processed  - /v1/payments?currency=USD&status=Processed n- /v1/payments?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]

    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)

The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    page = 1 # int | The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response.  (optional) (default to 1)
    page_size = 20 # int | The number of records returned per page in the response.  (optional) (default to 20)
    zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional)
    account_id = 'account_id_example' # str | This parameter filters the response based on the `accountId` field. (optional)

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   | [optional] 
 **accept_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] 
 **content_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] 
 **authorization** | **str**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] 
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in.

Unapply a payment

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Unapplies an applied payment from invoices and debit memos.  When you unapply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will unapply from must be less than or equal to 15,000.  If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions: - If you want to unapply one payment without specifying invoices or debit memos, you have to specify the invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one payment from multiple specified invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one payment from a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.  For more information, see [Unapply Payments from Invoices and Debit Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Unapply_Payments_from_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).
