Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer&#39;s next billing period to the target date.    **Note:**    - This field can only be used if the subscription renewal term is not set to 0.           - The credit memo item data is only available if you have Invoice Settlement feature enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
