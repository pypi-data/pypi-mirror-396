Cancel an adjustment

This REST API reference describes how to cancel an unbilled adjustment.  **Note**: The Adjustments feature is in the Early Adopter phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Billing_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center).

Create an adjustment

This REST API reference describes how to create one or more adjustments for a subscription.   **Note**: The Adjustments feature is in the Early Adopter phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Billing_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.  **Note**: Please note that this API supports the partial success scenario: when there is at least one eligible adjustment for the given time period, it will return “success = true” and include both eligible adjustments and ineligible adjustments in the response; only when no adjustment is eligible, it will return “success=false”.

List all adjustments of the latest version subscription

This REST API reference describes how to retrieve detailed information about adjustments of a subscription with the latest version.  **Note**: The Adjustments feature is in the Early Adopter phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Billing_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.get_billing_adjustments_by_subscription_number_response import GetBillingAdjustmentsBySubscriptionNumberResponse
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]

(optional)

This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

Preview an adjustment

This REST API describes how to preview adjustments of a subscription. n**Note**: The Adjustments feature is in the Early Adopter phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Billing_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.  **Note**: Please note that this API supports the partial success scenario: when there is at least one eligible adjustment for the given time period, it will return “success = true” and include both eligible adjustments and ineligible adjustments in the response; only when no adjustment is eligible, it will return “success=false”.
