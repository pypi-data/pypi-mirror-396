Cancel a stored credential profile

Cancels a stored credential profile within a payment method.  Cancelling the stored credential profile indicates that the stored credentials are no longer valid, per a customer request. You cannot reactivate the stored credential profile after you have cancelled it. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.create_update_stored_credential_profile_response import CreateUpdateStoredCredentialProfileResponse
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.PaymentMethodsApi(api_client)
    payment_method_id = 'payment_method_id_example' # str | ID of a payment method.
    profile_number = 56 # int | Number that identifies a stored credential profile within the payment method.
    idempotency_key = 'idempotency_key_example' # str | Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   (optional)
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional)
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

Create a payment session

When implementing Apple Pay integration by using Zuora's JavaScript SDK, use this operation to create a payment session on your server side. The response of this API operation contains a token for the payment session data. Send the token back to your client side to use in the subsequent implementation step. For more information, see [Set up Apple Pay through the JavaScript SDK approach](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payment_Methods/B_Define_Payment_Methods/Set_up_Apple_Pay_for_gateway_integrations_other_than_Adyen_Integration_v2.0). 

### Example

Delete a payment method

Deletes a credit card payment method.  If the specified payment method is the account's default payment method, the request will fail.  In that case, you must first designate a different payment method for that customer to be the default. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python

Expire a stored credential profile

Expires a stored credential profile within a payment method.  Expiring the stored credential profile indicates that the stored credentials are no longer valid, per an expiration policy in the stored credential transaction framework. You cannot reactivate the stored credential profile after you have expired it.

Scrub a payment method

 This operation enables you to replace all sensitive data in a payment method, related payment method snapshot table, and four related log tables with dummy values that will be stored in Zuora databases.   This operation will scrub the sensitive data and soft-delete the specified payment method at the same time.   If you want to delete or anonymize personal data in Zuora, you must scrub the payment method before anonymizing the associated account and contact. See [Delete or anonymize personal data](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Responding_to_individual_requests_for_access%2C_correction%2C_and_deletion_of_data_under_applicable_privacy_laws#Edit_and_correct_personal_data) for more information.  **Note:** In order to use this operation, you must ensure that the **Scrub Sensitive Data of Specific Payment Method payments** permission is enabled in your user role. Contact your tenant administrator if you want to enable this permission. See [Scrub Payment Methods](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/L_Payment_Methods/Scrub_Payment_Methods) for more information.

# **verify_payment_method**
> VerifyPaymentMethodResponse verify_payment_method(payment_method_id, body, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)

Verify a payment method

Sends an authorization request to the corresponding payment gateway to verify the payment method, even though no changes are made for the payment method. Supported payment methods are Credit Cards and Paypal.  Zuora now supports performing a standalone zero dollar verification or one dollar authorization for credit cards. It also supports a billing agreement status check on PayPal payment methods.  If a payment method is created by Hosted Payment Pages and is not assigned to any billing account, the payment method cannot be verified through this operation. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.verify_payment_method_request import VerifyPaymentMethodRequest
from zuora_sdk.models.verify_payment_method_response import VerifyPaymentMethodResponse
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.PaymentMethodsApi(api_client)
    payment_method_id = 'payment_method_id_example' # str | The ID of the payment method to be verified.
    body = zuora_sdk.VerifyPaymentMethodRequest() # VerifyPaymentMethodRequest | 
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.

    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

    try:
        # Verify a payment method
        api_response = api_instance.verify_payment_method(payment_method_id, body, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)
