# **execute_invoice_schedule**

Execute an invoice schedule

Executes an invoice schedule immediately.  During the execution, a bill run is created and generates an invoice or a credit memo asynchronously. nWhen you use this API operation to execute an invoice schedule item, you have the flexibility to decide whether to specify a specific item ID.  - If you specify the unique ID of an invoice schedule item to be executed in the request, the corresponding invoice schedule item is executed. - If you do not specify the ID of any invoice schedule item in the request, the subscription end date is used as the target date to determine the next pending schedule item to be executed.   For more samples, see [Execute invoice schedules](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Billing_Schedule/Billing_Schedule_tutorials/Execute_invoice_schedules).

Pause an invoice schedule

Pauses an invoice schedule immediately.  After one invoice schedule is paused, it cannot be automatically executed by Zuora Scheduler or by the [Execute an invoice schedule](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_ExecuteInvoiceSchedule/) API operation.  If you want to run a paused invoice schedule, you can create a bill run with the target date greater than the next run date of the invoice schedule.

You can use this API operation to update invoice schedules in the following aspects: - Update notes and pending invoice schedule items - Update orders associated with invoice schedules - Remove or add invoice schedule items  For more samples, see [Edit invoice schedules](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Billing_Schedule/Billing_Schedule_tutorials/Edit_invoice_schedules). n### Restrictions and limitations   When updating invoice schedules through the REST API, keep the following restrictions and limitations in mind: - You can only update invoice schedule items in Pending status. - You can only add orders or specific subscriptions to pending invoice schedules, and remove orders or specific subscriptions from pending invoice schedules. - For the invoice schedule items that you want to update, you must include the new values for these items in the request. - For the invoice schedule items that you want to keep unchanged, you must include all the existing information about these items in the request. Otherwise, the existing invoice schedule items that you do not mention in the request are deleted. - For the orders that you want to keep unchanged for an invoice schedule, you must include all the existing order numbers associated with the invoice schedule in the request. Otherwise, the existing orders that you do not mention in the request are removed. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.invoice_schedule_response import InvoiceScheduleResponse
from zuora_sdk.models.update_invoice_schedule_request import UpdateInvoiceScheduleRequest
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.InvoiceSchedulesApi(api_client)
    schedule_key = 'schedule_key_example' # str | The unique ID or number of the invoice schedule to be updated. For example, 2c92c8955bd63cc1015bd7c151af02ab or IS-0000001.
    request = zuora_sdk.UpdateInvoiceScheduleRequest() # UpdateInvoiceScheduleRequest | 
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional)
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

    try:
        # Update an invoice schedule
        api_response = api_instance.update_invoice_schedule(schedule_key, request, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)
        print("The response of InvoiceSchedulesApi->update_invoice_schedule:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling InvoiceSchedulesApi->update_invoice_schedule: %s\n" % e)
```
