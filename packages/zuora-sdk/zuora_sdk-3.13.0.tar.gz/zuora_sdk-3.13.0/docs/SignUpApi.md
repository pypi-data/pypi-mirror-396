Sign up

This call performs many actions. You can use this operation to implement the standard requirements for signing up a customer, such as validating the uniqueness of an account and limiting the number of subscriptions per account. Also, you can use this operation to create a subscription, generate an invoice, and collect payment for a new or existing customer.   **Note:** You need to have the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Subscriptions/Orders) or [Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization) feature enabled to use this API.  For a new customer, you can perform the following tasks in one call. Note that you can skip creating a payment meethod and still get the subscription and invoice successfully created. * Create an account * Create a payment method * Subscribe to a product in the product catalog and create a subscription * Generate an invoice * Collect payment nFor an existing customer, you can use an account identification field of an external system to specify the account.  You can make [make asynchronous requests](https://www.zuora.com/developer/rest-api/general-concepts/async-requests/) when using the \"Sign up\" operation. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.sign_up_request import SignUpRequest
from zuora_sdk.models.sign_up_response import SignUpResponse
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.SignUpApi(api_client)
    body = zuora_sdk.SignUpRequest() # SignUpRequest | 
    idempotency_key = 'idempotency_key_example' # str | Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   (optional)
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    accept = 'accept_example' # str | Expressed as MIME types that the client is able to understand. Using content negotiation, the server then selects one of the proposals, uses it and informs the client of its choice with the `Content-Type` response header. The possible response MIME types are `application/json-seq` compatible with http://jsonlines.org/, and `text/csv` compatible with RFC 4180. `application/json-seq` is the default response MIME type. If the `Accept` header is not specified, or set */*, the response body is returned in application/json-seq MIME type.  (optional)
    zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional)
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)
