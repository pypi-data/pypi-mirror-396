 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] 
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.

# **settle_payment**
> PaymentResponse settle_payment(payment_key, request, idempotency_key=idempotency_key, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)

Settle a payment

Sets the Gateway State field of the payment to \"Settled\" and returns the Payment object as response. 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.payment_response import PaymentResponse
from zuora_sdk.models.settle_payment_request import SettlePaymentRequest
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.PaymentGatewayReconciliationApi(api_client)
    payment_key = 'payment_key_example' # str | The payment number starting with \"P-\" or the unique payment ID.
    request = zuora_sdk.SettlePaymentRequest() # SettlePaymentRequest | 
    idempotency_key = 'idempotency_key_example' # str | Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   (optional)
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional)
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

    try:
        # Settle a payment
        api_response = api_instance.settle_payment(payment_key, request, idempotency_key=idempotency_key, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)
        print("The response of PaymentGatewayReconciliationApi->settle_payment:\n")
