If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs.

 **accept_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] 
 **content_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] 
 **authorization** | **str**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **emails** | **str**| If sendEmail parameter is set to true, comma separated values of emails can be specified. Example email1@test.com,email2@test.com. | [optional] 
 **comments** | **str**| Content of the email to be sent. | [optional]

 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] 
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] 
 **accept_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] 
 **content_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] 
 **authorization** | **str**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional]
