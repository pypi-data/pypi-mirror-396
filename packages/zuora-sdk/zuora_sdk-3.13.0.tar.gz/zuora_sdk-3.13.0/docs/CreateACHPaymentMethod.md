# CreateACHPaymentMethod


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**account_key** | **str** | Internal ID of the customer account that will own the payment method. To create an orphan payment method that is not associated with any customer account, you do not need to specify this field during creation. However, you must associate the orphan payment method with a customer account within 10 days. Otherwise, this orphan payment method will be deleted.  | [optional] 
**payment_method_number** | **str** | To avoid the repetitive creation of identical payment methods, you can associate a unique identifier with the payment method.  You can specify a string within the allowed limits, or if none is provided, the system will automatically generate one for the payment method.  | [optional] 
**payment_gateway_number** | **str** | The natural key for the payment gateway. | [optional] 
**screening_amount** | **float** | For [Chase Paymentech Orbital Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payment_gateway_integrations/Supported_payment_gateways/Chase_Orbital_Payment_Gateway) integrations,  if the Safetech Fraud service is enabled, use this field to pass in the amount used for fraud screening for Credit Card validation transactions.  Two-decimal amount is supported.  If the &#x60;screeningAmount&#x60; field is not specified, the authorization amount is used for fraud screening.  | [optional] 
**auth_gateway** | **str** | Internal ID of the payment gateway that Zuora will use to authorize the payments that are made with the payment method.

For validating SEPA payment methods on Stripe v2, this field is required.  | [optional] 
**make_default** | **bool** | Specifies whether the payment method will be the default payment method of the customer account that owns the payment method. Only applicable if the &#x60;accountKey&#x60; field is set.
