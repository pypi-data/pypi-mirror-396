# scietex.hal.vacuum_gauge

`scietex.hal.vacuum_gauge` is a Python library for interfacing with and emulating vacuum gauges
from various manufacturers, including Edwards, Leybold, and Erstevak. It provides a modular
framework for converting analog voltage outputs to pressure readings and communicating with gauges
over RS485 protocols. The library is designed for use in scientific and industrial applications,
offering both client-side interaction with physical hardware and server-side emulation for testing
and development.

## Features
- **Analog Gauge Support**: Convert voltage outputs to pressure readings (in millibars)
  for Edwards (APG-M, APG-L), Leybold (TTR 101 N), and Erstevak (MTP4D, MTM9D) gauges using 
  interpolation or exponential formulas.
- **RS485 Communication**: Full support for Erstevak’s RS485 protocol (version 1),
  including client-side control and server-side emulation.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into subpackages (`base`, `edwards`, `leybold`, `erstevak`)
  for easy extension to additional manufacturers or models.
- **Atmospheric Adjustments**: Apply gas-specific correction factors to pressure calculations.
- **Emulation**: Simulate Erstevak gauge behavior for testing without physical hardware.
- **Backends**: Supports `pymodbus` and `pyserial` for flexible RS485 communication.

## System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9 or higher.
- **Operating Systems**: Compatible with **Linux** and **macOS**.

## Installation

To install the package, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install scietex.hal.vacuum_gauge
```
