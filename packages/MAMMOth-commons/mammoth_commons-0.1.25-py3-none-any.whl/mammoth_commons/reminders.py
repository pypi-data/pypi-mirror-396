<p>Fairness does not end after producing AI outputs.</p>
 💡 Continue interacting with stakeholders to assert that their idea of fairness is correctly implemented.<br>
 💡 Monitor the outputs of deployed systems by rerunning the analysis on updated models and datasets.<br>
 💡 Test model and dataset variations for multiple sensitive characteristics and parameters.
<div style='margin-top: 10px;'><p>Keep a balance between justifying outputs as part of a fair process 
and accommodating constructive criticism. Do not over-rely on technical justification, and ensure 
meaningful human oversight whenever AI systems are deployed in decision-making, 
high-stakes, or rights-impacting contexts. Human oversight prevents overreliance on imperfect models, 
catches context-specific errors, and enables ethical judgment, accountability, and recourse for 
affected people.</p></div>
