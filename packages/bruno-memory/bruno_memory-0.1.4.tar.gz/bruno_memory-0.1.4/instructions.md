All the details about project overview is in project_overview.md.

1.0 You need to create a plan first with parent tasks and children tasks
2.0 Create a progress tracker in the plan so that we will keep track of the 
    implementation phase by phase, in case you will doing a particular task
    we will know where we left off and what to do next
3.0 After creating plan we will start implementation one by one
4.0 create an md file for the plan 


lets do one thing, lets start from scratch, delete all implementation code for phase 1 and phase 2, keep only implementation_plan and project_overview.md, start from beginning, use the libraries at following urls: https://github.com/meggy-ai/bruno-core
https://github.com/meggy-ai/bruno-llm, develop phase 0 first and we will go to phase 1, Update implementation plan VERY EXPLICITLY THAT WE NEED TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION KEEPING THE CODE ALIGNED WITH THE LIBRARIES BRUNO-CORE and BRUNO-LLM, if there is alignment problem between bruno-core and bruno-llm, ALERT ME AND ASK ME TO FIX THAT FIRST BEFORE WE IMPLEMENT THIS LAYER
