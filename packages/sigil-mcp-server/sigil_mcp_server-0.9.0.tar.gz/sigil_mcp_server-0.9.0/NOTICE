ADDITIONAL ATTRIBUTIONS

Trigram Indexing Concept:
The trigram-based text search implementation in this project is inspired by
GitHub's Blackbird search engine and the academic research on trigram indexing
for code search. While the implementation is original, the concept and approach
are based on these public resources.

Symbol Extraction:
Symbol extraction functionality leverages Universal Ctags, a mature open-source
tool for generating tag files from source code. When used, ctags runs as a
separate external process and does not link with this codebase.
