## Update

- Have added a small update to my code which allows tor scraping 
- you will need proxies if there are no proxies configured it will try to connect to tor via tor browser so you must have it open and connected
- if you want to use the tor expert bundle you can type tor bundle for proxies
- Thats it for 2.2
