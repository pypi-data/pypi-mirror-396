# WebScraper 

Thank you for checking out my web scraper! This tool allows you to easily scrape websites for **titles, text, links, and meta tags**, with options for depth crawling and JSON output.

---

## Features

- Scrape a single page or crawl multiple pages with a depth option
- Extract page **title**, **text**, **links**, and **meta tags**
- Save results as **JSON** or print them nicely with **pretty print**
- Optional live status reporting
- Fun banners and legal notice (can be disabled)
- CLI interface for easy usage
- im the sole developer im so tired bro 

---

## Update

- Have added a small update to my code which allows tor scraping 
- you will need proxies if there are no proxies configured it will try to connect to tor via tor browser so you must have it open and connected
- if you want to use the tor expert bundle you can type tor bundle for proxies
- Thats it for 2.2
