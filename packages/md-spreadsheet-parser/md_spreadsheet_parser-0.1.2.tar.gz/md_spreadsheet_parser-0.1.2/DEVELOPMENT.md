# Developer Guide

This document contains information for developers contributing to or maintaining the `md-spreadsheet-parser`.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to be a lightweight, pure Python parser for Markdown tables. It is intended to be compiled into a `.whl` file and run within a WebAssembly environment (Pyodide) inside a VS Code extension.

### Key Design Principles

1.  **Pure Python**: No C-extensions or heavy dependencies. Must run in Pyodide.
2.  **Modular Schemas**: Parsing logic is controlled by `ParsingSchema` objects to support multiple Markdown flavors (GFM, etc.) in the future without rewriting core logic.
3.  **Pure Functions**: The core `parse` function takes input and configuration and returns output without side effects.

## Environment Setup

This project uses `uv` for package management.

1.  **Install uv**:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing.

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Type Checking

This project is typed. Ensure `py.typed` is present in the package.

### Documentation

This project uses `mkdocs` with `mkdocs-material` for documentation.

To serve the documentation locally (auto-reloading):
```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

To build the static documentation site (outputs to `site/`):
```bash
uv run mkdocs build
```

### Code Style & Linting

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting.

To check for linting errors:
```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

To format code:
```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

### Building the Package

To create the `.whl` file for distribution (or for the VS Code extension):

```bash
uv run python -m build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.
- `dist/*.whl`: The wheel file to be used in the VS Code extension.
- `dist/*.tar.gz`: Source distribution.

## Integration with VS Code Extension

1.  Build the wheel: `uv run python -m build`
2.  Copy the generated `.whl` file to the `assets/` directory of the VS Code extension.
3.  In the VS Code extension (TypeScript), use `micropip` to install the wheel into the Pyodide environment.

## Publishing to PyPI

This project uses `uv` for building and publishing.

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
    *   Create an API Token in your PyPI account settings.

2.  **Build the Package**:
    ```bash
    uv build
    ```

3.  **Publish**:
    ```bash
    # Using uv (recommended)
    uv publish --token <your-pypi-token>

    # Or using twine (traditional)
    # pip install twine
    # twine upload dist/*
    ```

    *Note: For the first release, you might want to try [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) first.*
