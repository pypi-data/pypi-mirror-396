 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The State interface for a simulator.
 *
 * This interface is used to define the state of a simulator.
 * Exposes functions to initialize, configure, allocate qubits, measure, apply
 * reset on qubits, and obtain probabilities. Also allows to register observers
 * that will be notified when the state changes.
 *
 * The interface could be used to pass around the state of a simulator, if
 * operations on the state are not required.
