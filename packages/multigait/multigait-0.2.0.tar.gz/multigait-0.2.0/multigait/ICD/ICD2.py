class McCamleyIC(BaseIcDetector):
    """
    Detect initial contact (IC) using the McCamley algorithm for use with lowback devices,
     and with wrist-worn accelerometer data.

    This algorithm enhances peaks of the norm of the 3D acceleration vector (wrist version) or the vertical axis of the acceleration (lowback versions) and uses a combination of
    resampling, filtering, integration, and peak detection to estimate initial contact events.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _DOWNSAMPLED_RATE : int
        The rate (Hz) to which the signal is downsampled for processing.
    ic_list_ : pd.DataFrame
        Detected initial contact indices (resampled to original rate) with step IDs as the index.
    final_signal_ : np.ndarray
        The processed signal after filtering and integration, used for IC detection.

    Notes
    -----
    - Currently the IC distance thresholds are checked dynamically, which should provide the best results.
       If two ICs are closer than 0.25s, it is possible to keep the one with the highest acceleration magnitude.
    - The algorithm is sample-rate agnostic since signals are internally resampled to 50 Hz.
    - The improved and wrist versions use an adaptive center frequency for the cwt filter while the original (lowback) version uses a fixed value (1Hz).
    - We inherit from BaseIcDetector to guarantee a consistent detect() contract, gain a built-in clone() helper for safe reuse,
        and integrate with tpcp-based pipelines and utilities.
