    """
    Implementation of the Gait Sequence Detection algorithm by Kheirkhahan et al. (2017) [1].

    This implementation includes original and improved versions for lower back and is adapted and fine-tuned for wrist-worn accelerometer data.
    The algorithm detects gait sequences from the data by following these steps:

    1. Preprocessing: The input accelerometer data is preprocessed by calculating the norm of the three axes.
    2. Activity Counts Calculation: The norm signal is used to calculate activity counts per second.
    3. Windowing and Outlier Removal: The activity counts are divided into overlapping windows, and outliers are removed.
    4. Activity Parameter Calculation: An inactivity parameter is calculated for each window.
    5. Walking Detection: Windows with inactivity parameters below a threshold are marked as walking.
    6. Sequence Generation: The detected walking windows are interpolated to the original data length, and gait sequences are generated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    gs_list_ : pd.DataFrame
        The detected gait sequences.

    Notes
    -----
    - Implementation for both possitions include the acceleration norm.
    - Algorithm works with sampling rate ≥ 30 Hz.
    - Data are converted from m/s² to g-units before activity counts calculation.
    - Optionally, detected micro walking bouts can be returned if cwb is False. For use with the pipeline bouts should be merged into Continuous Walking Bouts (CWB).
