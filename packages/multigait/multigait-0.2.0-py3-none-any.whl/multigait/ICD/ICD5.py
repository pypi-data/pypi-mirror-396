class DucharmeIC(BaseIcDetector):
    """
    Implementation of the Ducharme initial contact (IC) detection algorithm [1],
    for lowback devices (original and fine-tuned versions) and fine-tuned for wrist-worn accelerometer data.
    This is a peak detection method applied to a bandpass-filtered Euclidean norm of the acceleration signal.

        Workflow:
    1. Compute the Euclidean norm of the tri-axial accelerometer data.
    2. Detrend the signal by subtracting its mean.
    3. Downsample to 80 Hz, then apply a bandpass Butterworth filter (0.25–2.5 Hz).
    4. Detect peaks in the filtered signal that exceed the threshold.
    5. Upsample detected peak indices back to the original sampling rate.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ic_list_ : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing the indices of the detected initial contact events,
        resampled back to the original sampling rate.
    threshold : float
        Threshold for peak detection, adjusted from g to m/s².

    Notes
    -----
    - Threshold adjusted from g to m/s².
    - Resampling is performed because the original implementation used lower sampling rates.
    - Algorithm is sample-rate agnostic since all processing is performed at 80 Hz, and
      results are mapped back to the original rate.
    - Bandpass filtering compared to the original implementation in R: padding may differ and he beginning/end of the signal are more affected by filtering in Python, which is smoother.
      This can lead to first peak being under the threshold.
    - We inherit from BaseIcDetector to guarantee a consistent detect() contract, gain a built-in clone() helper for safe reuse,
        and integrate with tpcp-based pipelines and utilities.
