class PhamIC(BaseIcDetector):
    """
    This implementation of the Pham initial contact (IC) detection algorithm [1] supports versions for lowback devices (original and fine-tuned thresholds),
     as well as a version designed and fine tuned for wrist-worn accelerometer data.
    It enhances peaks of the acceleration vector by smoothing the signal using resampling, detrending, filtering, and integration.
    The anteroposterior axis is used for the lowback versions and the acceleration norm for the wrist version.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _UPSAMPLED_RATE : int
        The target rate (Hz) to which the signal is upsampled for filtering (128 Hz).
    ic_list_ : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame storing the detected initial contact indices resampled back to the original signal rate.
    final_signal_ : np.ndarray
        The processed signal after resampling, detrending, filtering, and integration.

    Notes
    -----
    - The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) center frequency is chosen adaptively based on the dominant frequency of the signal,
      constrained to 1–5 Hz for smoothing purposes (fine-tuned versions for the lowback and wrist) while on the original version it is fixed to 1.
    - The algorithm is sample-rate agnostic because all signals are internally upsampled to 128 Hz, processed, and then resampled
      back to the original sampling rate.
    - Only peaks exceeding a percentage threshold of the mean peak magnitude are considered valid ICs.
    - We inherit from BaseIcDetector to guarantee a consistent detect() contract, gain a built-in clone() helper for safe reuse,
      and integrate with tpcp-based pipelines and utilities.

        """
        Detect initial contact (IC) events using the Pham algorithm.

        This method processes the acceleration signal by:
        1. Computing the vector norm of the tri-axial accelerometer (wrist), or selects the anteroposterior axis (lowback).
        2. Upsampling to 128 Hz.
        3. Detrending and low-pass Butterworth filtering.
        4. Cumulative trapezoidal integration.
        5. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) filtering using either fixed or adaptive frequency.
        6. Downsampling back to the original signal rate.
        7. Peak detection with a threshold to identify initial contacts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : pd.DataFrame
            Input accelerometer data. The first three columns should contain x, y, z acceleration axes.
        sampling_rate_hz : float
            Original sampling rate of the input signal in Hz.

        Returns
        -------
        Self
            Returns the instance with detected initial contacts stored in `ic_list_` and the processed signal in `final_signal_`.
