    Retrieve Jira boards either by specifying their names or IDs, or get all
    available boards.
    All requests support offset and limit with a maximum of 50 boards returned per call.

    MANDATORY ACTION: ALWAYS when you need to get multiple boards, you must
    include all the board identifiers in a single call rather than making
    multiple separate tool calls, as this provides much better performance, not doing that will
    bring huge performance penalties.

    The tool automatically handles mixed identifier types (names and IDs), deduplicates results, and
    falls back from ID lookup to name lookup when needed.
