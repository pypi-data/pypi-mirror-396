"""
A `Database` in epymorph organizes data attributes in a hierarchical namespace of three
components, as in: "strata::module::attribute_id".

The goal is to be as flexibile as possible for users specifying requirements and values
which fulfill those requirements. For example, you can provide a value for
"*::*::population" to indicate that every strata and every module should use the same
value if they require a "population" attribute. Or you can provide "*::init::population"
to indicate that only initializers should use this value, and, presumably, another value
is more appropriate for other modules like movement.

Specialized database instances provide the ability to "layer" data for a simulation --
if the outermost database has a matching value, that value is used, otherwise the search
for a match proceeds to the inner layers (recursively).

class DataResolver:
    """
    Stores evaluated data attributes for a simulation.

    Data (typically parameter values) are provided by the user as a collection
    of key-value pairs, with the values in several forms. These are evaluated
    to turn them into our internal data representation which is optimized for
    simulation execution.

    Users typically provide parameter values with keys in `NamePattern` form, but
    during parameter resolution values are stored by `AbsoluteName` to facilitate
    lookups by the systems that use them. It is possible that multiple `AbsoluteNames`
    resolve to the same value (which is done in a memory-efficient way).

    Data requirements also specify the expected type and shape of the data,
    and `DataResolver` also manages the resulting complexity. Two requirements could be
    fulfilled by the same value while having different type and shape specifications.
    Instead of rejecting this as an error, epymorph allows this provided the given value
    can be successfully coerced to fit both requirements independently. For example, a
    scalar integer value can be coerced to fit requirements for an N-shaped array of
    floats as well as a T-shaped array of integers. `DataResolver` accomplishes this
    in an efficient way by storing both the original values and all adapted values.
    If multiple requirements specify the same type/shape adaptation for one value,
    the adaptation only needs to happen once.

    `DataResolver` is partially mutable -- new values can be added but values cannot
    be overwritten or removed.

    A requirements tree describes how data requirements are resolved for a RUME.
