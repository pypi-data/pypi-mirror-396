[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cockup?link=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Fproject%2Fcockup%2F)](https://pypi.org/project/cockup/)

English | [中文](README_zh-cn.md)

Yet another backup tool for various configurations.

## Installation

### PyPI

```bash
pip install cockup
```

### Homebrew

```bash
# Single-line installation
brew install huaium/tap/cockup

# Or, using `brew tap`
brew tap huaium/tap
brew install cockup
```

### Install from source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project root, and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### `cockup list`

You may want to use it as a reference when writing your own backup rules.

```bash
# List potential config paths for all installed Homebrew casks
cockup list

# List potential config paths for specified cask
cockup list cask-name-1 [cask-name-n...]
```

### `cockup backup & restore`

```bash
# Backup files according to configuration
cockup backup /path/to/config.yaml

# Restore files from backup
cockup restore /path/to/config.yaml
```

### `cockup hook`

```bash
# Run hooks interactively
cockup hook /path/to/config.yaml

# Or, run a specified hook by its name
cockup hook /path/to/config.yaml --name hook_name
```

## Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file with the following structure:

### Required Fields

```yaml
# Where backups are stored
# If you use relative path, it will be relative to the config file's directory
destination: "/path/to/backup/directory"

# List of backup rules
rules:
  - from: "/source/directory"
    targets: ["*.conf", "*.json"]
    to: "subdirectory"
```

### Optional Fields

```yaml
# Include rules and hooks from other config files
include:
  - "./another_config.yaml"

# Clean mode, whether to remove existing backup folder (default: false)
clean: false

# Whether to preserve metadata when backing up (default: true)
metadata: true

# Global hooks
hooks:
  pre-backup:
    - name: "Setup"
      command: ["echo", "Starting backup"]
  post-backup:
    - name: "Cleanup"
      command: ["echo", "Backup complete"]
  pre-restore:
    - name: "Prepare"
      command: ["echo", "Starting restore"]
  post-restore:
    - name: "Finish"
      command: ["echo", "Restore complete"]
```

### Rule Structure

Each rule defines what to backup:

```yaml
- from: "/source/directory/in/pattern" # Wildcards are supported
  targets:
    # Folders or files under `from`
    - "pattern1" # Wildcards are also supported
    - "relative/path/to/file"
  to: "backup/subdirectory" # A folder under `destination`
  on-start: # Optional rule-level hooks
    - name: "Before Rule"
      command: ["echo", "Processing rule"]
  on-end:
    - name: "After Rule"
      command: ["echo", "Rule complete"]
```

Please be aware that when using wildcards in `from`, to prevent duplicate files caused by matching multiple directories, cockup will locate the first safe directory without wildcards and set it as `from`. The paths containing wildcards encountered during the search process will be prepended to each `target`.

For example, if you have:

```yaml
- from: "/source/directory/in/prefix*/pattern"
  targets:
    - "relative/path/to/file"
  to: "backup/subdirectory"
```

We will finally get:

```yaml
- from: "/source/directory/in"
  targets:
    - "prefix*/pattern/relative/path/to/file"
  to: "backup/subdirectory"
```

### Hook Structure

Hooks support custom commands.

By default, you will be prompted to confirm if your configuration file contains any hooks. Use the flag `--quiet` or `-q` to suppress it.

If you want to run them within a specified shell, use commands like `bash -c` after ensuring your commands are safe.

```yaml
- name: "Hook Name" # Required: Hook identifier
  command: ["cmd", "arg1"] # Required: Command args list
  output: false # Optional: Print output (default: false)
  timeout: 10 # Optional: Timeout in seconds
  env: # Optional: environment variables used for the command
    ENV_1: 1
    ENV_2: 2
```

Please note that you cannot pass environment variables directly using syntax like `$ENV_1`, but the subprocess you launch can access those variables.

For example, you may want to use it to dump Homebrew bundle into a file and place it under the folder defined by `destination`:

```yaml
- name: "Brewfile Dumping"
  command: ["brew", "bundle", "dump", "--force", "--file", "Brewfile"]
  output: true
  timeout: 10
```

### Include

You can simply include rules and hooks from other configuration files using `include`.

Please note that only rules and hooks will be included, and they will be placed before the rules and hooks defined in the main config, using the `clean` and `metadata` fields from the main config for execution.

```yaml
include:
  - "path_to/config_one.yaml"
  - "path_to/config_two.yaml"
```

Refer to [sample](sample) to view a configuration demo.

## Development

Basically, this project use `just` to unify the development workflow. If you are not going to use it, please refer to `justfile` in the project root to get access to the original commands.

### Install test dependencies

Use `pytest` as the test framework.

```bash
just sync-all
```

### Run directly

With the command form of `just run [ARGS]`.

```bash
# `cockup list`
just run list

# `cockup backup`
just run backup /path/to/config.yaml
```

### Run sample

A [sample](sample) with minimal configs is provided for manual testing.

```bash
# Test `cockup backup`
just sample-backup

# Or test `cockup restore`
just sample-restore

# Or test `cockup hook`
just sample-hook [hook_name]
```

### Test

`just test` works as an alias for `pytest`.

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run with coverage
just test --cov=cockup

# Run specific test
just test tests/test_config.py -v
```

### Build

`just build` works as an alias for `uv build`.
