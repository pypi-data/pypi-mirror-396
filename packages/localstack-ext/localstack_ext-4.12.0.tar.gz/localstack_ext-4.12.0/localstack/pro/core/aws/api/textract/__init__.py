        -  Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in
           two Block objects, each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET``: a KEY ``Block``
           object and a VALUE ``Block`` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva
           Carolina* contains a key and value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva
           Carolina* is the value.

        -  Table and table cell data. A TABLE ``Block`` object contains
           information about a detected table. A CELL ``Block`` object is
           returned for each cell in a table.

        -  Lines and words of text. A LINE ``Block`` object contains one or more
           WORD ``Block`` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the
           document are returned (including text that doesn't have a
           relationship with the value of ``FeatureTypes``).

        -  Signatures. A SIGNATURE ``Block`` object contains the location
           information of a signature in a document. If used in conjunction with
           forms or tables, a signature can be given a Key-Value pairing or be
           detected in the cell of a table.

        -  Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link
           to the associated Query results block object.

        -  Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the
           query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also
           contains a confidence score.

        Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio
        buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT
        ``Block`` object contains information about a selection element,
        including the selection status.

        You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the
        ``FeatureTypes`` list.

        The output is returned in a list of ``Block`` objects.

        You start asynchronous text analysis by calling StartDocumentAnalysis,
        which returns a job identifier (``JobId``). When the text analysis
        operation finishes, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the
        Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered
        in the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis``. To get the results of
        the text-detection operation, first check that the status value
        published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED``. If so, call
        ``GetDocumentAnalysis``, and pass the job identifier (``JobId``) from
        the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis``.

        ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` returns an array of Block objects. The following
        types of information are returned:

        -  Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in
           two Block objects, each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET``: a KEY ``Block``
           object and a VALUE ``Block`` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva
           Carolina* contains a key and value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva
           Carolina* is the value.

        -  Table and table cell data. A TABLE ``Block`` object contains
           information about a detected table. A CELL ``Block`` object is
           returned for each cell in a table.

        -  Lines and words of text. A LINE ``Block`` object contains one or more
           WORD ``Block`` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the
           document are returned (including text that doesn't have a
           relationship with the value of the ``StartDocumentAnalysis``
           ``FeatureTypes`` input parameter).

        -  Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link
           to the associated Query results block object.

        -  Query Results. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the
           query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also
           contains a confidence score.

        While processing a document with queries, look out for
        ``INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETERS`` output. This indicates that either the
        per page query limit has been exceeded or that the operation is trying
        to query a page in the document which doesn’t exist.

        Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio
        buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT
        ``Block`` object contains information about a selection element,
        including the selection status.

        Use the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of blocks that are
        returned. If there are more results than specified in ``MaxResults``,
        the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation response contains a
        pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next
        page of results, call ``GetDocumentAnalysis``, and populate the
        ``NextToken`` request parameter with the token value that's returned
