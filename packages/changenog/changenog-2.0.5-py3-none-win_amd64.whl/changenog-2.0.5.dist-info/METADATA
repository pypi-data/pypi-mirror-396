Zero-config changelog generator with monorepo support.

Parses Git tags and commits since last entry, restricts them by current working directory, and adds any missing entries to the changelog.

See this repo's changelog for example output.

| ---------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --overwrite            | boolean | overwrite existing changelog                                                                         |

| --output               | string  | output of the generated changelog. one of ['file', 'stdout']. default: 'file'                        |

| --max-entries          | number  | maximum number of entries to process. default: '100'                                                 |
| --tag-filter-regex     | regex   | regex pattern(s) that each tag must match to be included                                             |
| --commit-filter-regex  | regex   | regex pattern(s) that each commit must match to be included                                          |
| --commit-filter-preset | string  | filter preset(s) to use. one of ['angular', 'angular-readme-only-docs', 'no-changelog', 'no-semver'] |

### Filters

Multiple `--tag-filter-regex`, `--commit-filter-preset` and `--commit-filter-regex` options can be passed. A tag/commit must match _all_ filters to be included.

For example:

```sh
changenog --commit-filter-preset=angular --commit-filter-regex='^(?!.*changelog).*$'
```

Would filter:

```
✅
docs(readme): update usage
feat: add new feature
fix: fix bug
perf: improve performance

❌
chore: update dependencies
ci(release): release version
docs(changelog): v0.1.0
my commit message
```

#### Presets

- `angular` - include only `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, and `docs` commits that match the [Angular commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)
- `angular-readme-only-docs` - exclude Angular `docs` commits unless they have a scope of `readme`
- `no-changelog` - exclude all commits with `changelog` in the subject
- `no-semver` - exclude all commits that match the semver format, specifically, [this regex](https://semver.org/#is-there-a-suggested-regular-expression-regex-to-check-a-semver-string)

## Entry Strategy

This is the general strategy for building and filtering entries:

1. All entries are processed, restricted by `--max-entries`
2. Commits are filtered to only include those with changes in `--root`
3. If `<tag a>..<tag b>` have no commits, the tags are made part of the same entry
4. Commit filters are applied
5. If an entry has no commits, the entry is excluded
6. Tag filters are applied
7. If an entry has no tags, all commits are merged into the next entry

## Monorepo Support

If the git root is in a parent directory, `changenog` will filter commits to only include those that have changes within the subdirectory.

To include only the _tags_ that apply to that subdirectory, you can provide a `--tag-filter-regex` option, e.g. `--tag-filter-regex='my-package/.*'`. This is assuming you have a convention for tagging that scopes to that subdirectory.

## Known Limitations

### Cross-Branch Tag Ranges (Rebase/Squash Workflows)

When using rebase or squash merge workflows, the commits merged into the main branch are new commits, and any tag created on the merged branch remains pointing at their original commit. There's no way to link the new commits back to the original ones, so the changelog entry for a new tag will include the commits associated with the previous entry.

**Workarounds:**

- Manually delete the entries for these newer commits in the changelog
- Only create tags after merging to your target branch
- Use merge commits
