# UI Components

UI Components V3 are runtime component instances with validation and event routing. Forms, tables, charts, and file uploads can bind to flows/agents/tools via `UIEventRouter`. Validation prevents invalid submits; events dispatch to real runtime handlers. Studio Runner/Page panels render these components using the backend API.
