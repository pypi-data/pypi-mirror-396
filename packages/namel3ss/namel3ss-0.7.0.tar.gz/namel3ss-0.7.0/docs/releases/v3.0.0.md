# Namel3ss V3.0.0

Highlights:
- Stable DSL + diagnostics
- Agents V3 (planning, reflection, retries, teams)
- Flows V3 (branching, parallel, error boundaries, triggers)
- RAG V3 (hybrid, cross-store, reranking, rewriting)
- Plugins V3 (manifests, registry, SDK, Studio)
- Deployment V3 (server/worker, Docker, Lambda adapter, desktop/mobile skeletons)
- Optimizer (self-improving runtime with overlays)
- Studio panels for all subsystems + API surface stability checks
- VS Code extension (syntax + parse/diagnostics commands)

Stability promise: public CLI/HTTP/runtime surfaces remain stable for 12 months.
