# RAG Q&A Example

A small retrieval-style Q&A app that rewrites questions, fetches context with an AI helper, and composes an answer.

## Run with the CLI
```bash
n3 example run rag_qa
```

## Load in Studio
Open the IDE with:
```
http://localhost:8000/studio?example=rag_qa
```

The CLI run prints a trace link such as:
```
Open in Studio (trace):
http://localhost:8000/studio?trace=<trace_id>
```
Use it to inspect the rewrite, context lookup, and answer steps.
