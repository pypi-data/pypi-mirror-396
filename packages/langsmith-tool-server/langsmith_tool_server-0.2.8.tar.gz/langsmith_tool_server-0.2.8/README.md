# LangChain Tool Server

A dedicated tool server decouples the creation of specialized tools (e.g., for retrieving data from specific knowledge sources) from agent development. This separation enables different teams to contribute and manage tools independently. Agents can then be rapidly configured—by simply specifying a prompt and a set of accessible tools. This streamlined approach simplifies authentication and authorization and accelerates the deployment of agents into production.
