MCP Orchestration Examples for GTPyhop

This package contains examples of using GTPyhop for orchestrating workflows
that involve Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. These examples demonstrate
hierarchical task network (HTN) planning for complex scientific workflows
and cross-server coordination.

Examples:
- cross_server: Cross-server HTN plan execution orchestration demonstrating
  coordination between multiple MCP servers for robot manipulation tasks
- tnf_cancer_modelling: Multiscale TNF cancer modeling workflow integrating
  Boolean network modeling (MaBoSS) with agent-based simulation (PhysiCell)
