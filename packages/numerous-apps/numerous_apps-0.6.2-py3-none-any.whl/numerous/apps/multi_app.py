    Combine multiple Numerous apps into a single FastAPI application.

    This function creates a parent FastAPI application and mounts each sub-app
    at its specified path. Apps can share static files, themes, and optionally
    authentication.

    Args:
        apps: Dictionary mapping path prefixes to NumerousApp instances.
              Example: {"/app1": app1, "/app2": app2}
        shared_static_dir: Optional path to directory with shared static files.
                          Will be mounted at /shared-static/
        shared_theme_css: Optional CSS string for shared theme customization.
                         Will be served at /shared-static/css/theme.css
        root_redirect: Optional path to redirect "/" to (e.g., "/app1")
        shared_auth_provider: Optional shared authentication provider for all apps.
                             If provided, enables shared login at root level.
        title: Title for the combined application.
