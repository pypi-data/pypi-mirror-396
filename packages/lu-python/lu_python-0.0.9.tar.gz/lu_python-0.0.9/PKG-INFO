# lu — a vcr-style record/replay stubbing library for Python methods

lu (录) — Chinese for "recording".

lu provides a small context manager, `record()`, which can patch module-qualified functions or instance methods to record return values (or exceptions) to compressed pickle files and generate a `manifest.json` describing the recordings.

On the first run, the patched methods execute normally and their outputs are recorded. Subsequent runs replay the recorded return values (or re-raise recorded exceptions) instead of executing the original code — similar to how HTTP cassette libraries like vcrpy work, but for arbitrary Python methods.

## Quickstart

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install lu-python
```

Basic usage:

```python
import lu

with lu.record(
    target={
        'module1.Foo.expensive_method1': ['arg1', 'kwarg1'],
        'package2.module2.expensive_method2': ['arg2'],
    },
    recordings_dir='tests/fixtures/recordings/',
):
    from module1 import Foo
    foo = Foo()
    foo.expensive_method('bar', kwarg1=3)

    from package2 import module2
    module2.expensive_method2('baz')
```

See `tests/test_lu.py` for more examples.

## Using a YAML Configuration File

You can also define your recording configuration in a `lu.yaml` file:

```yaml
targets:
  module1.Foo.expensive_method1: [arg1, kwarg1]
  package2.module2.expensive_method2: [arg2]
recordings_dir: tests/fixtures/recordings/
manifest_file: tests/fixtures/recordings/recordings.json  # optional
short_hex_length: 6  # optional
```

Then use it in your code:

```python
import lu

with lu.record2():
    # your code here
    ...
```

## CLI Usage

lu provides a command-line interface for managing recordings:

### Remove recordings

Remove recordings that match a specific pattern:

```bash
lu remove PATTERN
```

This will:
1. Search for entries in the manifest file that contain the pattern (in entry IDs or entry data)
2. Remove matching entries from the manifest
3. Delete the corresponding physical recording files

Example:

```bash
# Remove all recordings related to a specific test
lu remove "test_user_login"

# Remove recordings for a specific method
lu remove "expensive_method1"
```

You can also specify a custom configuration file:

```bash
lu remove PATTERN --config path/to/custom.yaml
```

## Using with pytest

Add an autouse fixture (for example in `tests/conftest.py`) to enable recording/replay for the test session:

```python
import pytest
import lu

@pytest.fixture(scope='session', autouse=True)
def stub_calls():
    with lu.record(
        target={
            # 'module.Class.method': ['arg_name', 'kwarg_name'],
            # add targets you want recorded here
        },
        recordings_dir='tests/fixtures/recordings/',
    ):
        yield
```

## How lu differs from other tools

I wrote `lu` because I couldn't find a simple record/replay tool for arbitrary Python methods. A few alternatives exist but they don't match this use case:

- `testcontainers`: runs real services in Docker, which requires setup and infrastructure and does not provide automatic request/response recording.
- `keploy`: captures and replays network calls at a lower level; powerful but heavier-weight.
- `vcrpy` / `pytest-recordings`: focused on HTTP clients (requests/urllib3) only.
- `unittest.mock`: flexible but manual — `lu` provides an automated record-and-replay workflow on top of method patching.

`lu` works at the method level, so you can record calls to client libraries (e.g., database drivers, HTTP clients) or your own functions.

    subgraph L0 [Business Logic]

        B1{{unittest.mock, lu}}
    end

    subgraph L1 [Client Library]
        A[requests/urllib3/pyodbc]
        B{{vcrpy, pytest-recordings<br>unittest.mock,lu}}
    end

    subgraph L2 [Network]
        C[TCP/IP]
        D{{keploy}}
    end

    subgraph L3 [Data]
        E[Database]
        F{{testcontainers}}
    end

    %% Business logic
    A1 --> A
    A --> C
    C --> E
```

## Limitations

- Prefer using `lu` for read-only calls. While you can record methods with side effects (for example, database writes), `lu` does not maintain external state. Replaying a recorded write will not update a database or other external system.
- No transaction or rollback support. `lu` records and replays return values and exceptions only.
