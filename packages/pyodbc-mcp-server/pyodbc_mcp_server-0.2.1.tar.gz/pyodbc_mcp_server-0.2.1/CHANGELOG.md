## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-11

### Added
- **Async Architecture**: All tools now use `async`/`await` with `anyio.to_thread` for non-blocking database operations
- **Per-Request Connections**: Thread-safe connection pattern - fresh connections created per-request within worker threads (ODBC driver handles pooling at driver level)
- **MCP Resources**: 5 new resources for schema discovery:
  - `mssql://tables` - List all tables in the database
  - `mssql://views` - List all views in the database
  - `mssql://schema/{schema_name}` - Tables filtered by schema
  - `mssql://table/{table_name}/preview` - Preview table data (first 10 rows)
  - `mssql://info` - Database server information
- **Structured Logging**: Python `logging` module integration for operation tracking

### Changed
- Upgraded `fastmcp` dependency from `>=0.1.0` to `>=2.0.0`
- Added `anyio>=4.0.0` dependency for async thread pooling
- Added `pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0` to dev dependencies
- Tools now run database calls in background threads to prevent blocking
- Improved type annotations (using `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`)

### Fixed
- Thread safety ensured via per-request connection pattern (pyodbc threadsafety=1 compliance)
