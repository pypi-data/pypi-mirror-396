## [25.0]

### Added

 * Command line tool for scaffolding all the days (`adventofcode init`)
 * Support for Python 3.13 and 3.14

### Removed

 * `part_1_no_splitlines` and `part_2_no_splitlines` parameters. `part_1` and `part_2` now receive a `str` instead of `list[str]`. This was done to simplify the API.
 * Support for Python 3.8 and 3.9

## [23.0b1]

### Added

 * `assert_p1` and `assert_p2` methods to `AoC` class. Used for easily asserting your solutions against sample inputs.
 * `part_1`, `part_2` optional arguments to the `AoC` class. Used to pass in a Callable that will return the correct result for the given input. The callable will be called by `assert_p1`, `assert_p2`, `submit_p1` and `submit_p2` methods.
 * `part_1_no_splitlines` and `part_2_no_splitlines` optional arguments to `AoC` class. Used as an alternative to `part_1` and `part_2` for the rare cases when the input should not be split into lines.
