# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | Python Requirements |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1.0.20+ | :white_check_mark: | 3.12+              |
| < 1.0.20| :x:                | 3.10+              |

**Note**: Version 1.0.20+ uses Argon2id KDF and key commitment. Files encrypted with older versions are not compatible.

## Python Version Support Policy

We follow Python's official support timeline and drop support for versions that have reached end-of-life or are in security-only mode:

- **Python 3.10**: EOL October 2026 (no longer supported by this project)
- **Python 3.11**: EOL October 2027 (no longer supported by this project)
- **Python 3.12**: EOL October 2028 ✅
- **Python 3.13**: EOL October 2029 ✅
- **Python 3.14**: EOL October 2030 ✅

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. Thanks for helping us keep this project secure.

### How to Report

**Choose one of these methods:**

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred)
   - Go to [Security Advisories](https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the private form

2. **Email**
   - Send to: **<security@avondenecloud.uk>**
   - Don't create a public GitHub issue for vulnerabilities

### What to Include

- What's vulnerable and how it works
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Ideas for a fix (if you have them)

### What to Expect

1. **Initial response:** Within 24 hours
2. **Status updates:** At least every 72 hours
3. **Fix timeline:**
   - We'll publish a security advisory within 72 hours
   - Develop and test a fix within 1-2 weeks
   - Public disclosure after the fix is released (typically within 90 days)

## Security Features

This project implements multiple layers of security:

### 1. Cryptography

| Component | Implementation | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM | 256-bit key, 96-bit nonce, 128-bit tag |
| **Key Derivation** | Argon2id | 64MB memory, 3 iterations, parallelism 4 |
| **Key Commitment** | HMAC-SHA256 | Prevents partitioning oracle attacks |
| **Random Generation** | `secrets` module | OS-level CSPRNG |

**Argon2id parameters exceed OWASP 2024 recommendations** (minimum: 19MB memory, 2 iterations).

### 2. Password Protection

- **Minimum length**: 12 characters
- **Complexity requirements**: Mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Common password detection**: Blocks known weak passwords
- **Constant-time comparison**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Rate limiting**: Exponential backoff after failed attempts (5 attempts → 30s lockout)

### 3. File Security

- **100 MB file size limit** - Prevents DoS attacks
- **Atomic file writes** - No partial writes on failure
- **Secure permissions** - `chmod 600` (owner-only read/write)
- **Path validation** - Blocks path traversal (`../`, symlinks)
- **Filename sanitization** - Prevents Unicode attacks, null bytes

### 4. Vault Integrity

- **HMAC-SHA256 verification** - Detects tampering before decryption
- **Automatic backups** - Last 5 backups in `~/.secure-cipher/backups/`
- **Backup on modification** - Backup created before any vault change

### 5. Runtime Protection

- **Secure memory wiping** - `sodium_memzero()` via libsodium (PyNaCl)
- **SecureString/SecureBytes classes** - Auto-zero on deletion
- **Timing jitter** - Adds random delay to security operations
- **Input sanitization** - All user input validated
- **Audit logging** - Security events logged with timestamps

### 6. Audit Logging

Security-sensitive operations are logged to `~/.secure-cipher/audit.log`:

- Authentication successes/failures
- Rate limit triggers
- Encryption/decryption operations
- Vault access events
- Sensitive data automatically redacted

## User Security Guide

### Installing Safely

1. **Install from the official source**

   ```bash
   pip install secure-string-cipher
   ```

2. **Verify the package**
   - Official PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/secure-string-cipher/>
   - Maintainer: TheRedTower
   - Source code: <https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher>

3. **Check dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip show secure-string-cipher
   ```

### Using it Securely

1. **Passphrases**
   - Use strong, unique passphrases (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Use `/gen` at password prompts to generate secure passphrases
   - Don't reuse passphrases across different files
   - Store passphrases in a password manager or the built-in vault
   - Never share passphrases over insecure channels

2. **File Handling**
   - Store encrypted files in secure locations
   - Keep backups of encrypted files (but not with their passphrases)
   - Test decryption before deleting original files
   - Original files aren't automatically deleted after encryption

3. **Environment**
   - Use the tool on trusted, malware-free systems
   - Avoid shared or public computers
   - Clear your terminal history if it contains sensitive commands
   - Keep the software updated

## Supply Chain

### Dependencies

1. **What we depend on**
   - `cryptography` - Industry-standard cryptographic library (AES-GCM)

   - `pynacl` - libsodium bindings for secure memory
   - `pyperclip` - Clipboard support
   - `wcwidth` - Unicode width calculation
   - All from trusted, well-maintained sources

2. **How we vet dependencies**
   - Review dependencies for security issues
   - Run `pip-audit` for vulnerability scanning
   - Update promptly to address vulnerabilities

3. **Automated checks**
   - Pre-commit hooks with `detect-secrets` (prevents credential leaks)
   - CI/CD pipeline runs security checks on every commit
   - `pip-audit` scans for known vulnerabilities
