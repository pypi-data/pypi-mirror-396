# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Secure String Cipher! We appreciate any help making this encryption tool better.

## Security First

Since this is a security tool, we have a few special requirements:

1. **Security reviews** - Changes to cryptographic operations need review from at least two maintainers
2. **No security through obscurity** - All security measures must be well-documented and based on proven principles
3. **Dependency changes** - Updates to crypto dependencies must include a security impact analysis

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a Code of Conduct adapted from the Contributor Covenant. By participating, you agree to uphold it.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

* **Security issues** - Please report these privately to <security@avondenecloud.uk>
* **Regular bugs** - Use the GitHub issue tracker
* Include steps to reproduce, your OS, Python version, and any relevant logs

### Suggesting Features

* Use the GitHub issue tracker
* Explain your use case
* Consider backward compatibility and security implications

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. If you add code:
   * Write tests
   * Update docs
   * Follow the style guide
3. Make sure all tests pass
4. Keep commits clear and focused

## Development Setup

**Python 3.12+ required** (3.14 recommended for development).

```bash
# Install dependencies from the lockfile (keeps parity with CI)
uv sync --extra dev --locked

# Run tools through the locked environment
uv run --locked ruff check src tests
uv run --locked mypy src tests
uv run --locked pytest tests/ --maxfail=3 -n auto

# Optional: Make targets wrap the same commands
make format  # Auto-fix formatting
make ci      # Run full CI pipeline
```

See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for detailed workflow, troubleshooting, and release process.

## Style Guide

* Follow PEP 8
* Use type hints
* Document all public functions and classes
* Keep functions small and focused
* Use descriptive names
* Comment complex algorithms

## Testing

* Write tests for new features
* CI coverage gate: 69% (current: ~77%)
* Include positive and negative test cases
* Test edge cases and error conditions
* Use parameterized tests when appropriate

### Test Commands

```bash
# Direct (CI-parity)
uv run --locked ruff check src tests
uv run --locked mypy src tests
uv run --locked pytest tests/ --maxfail=3 -n auto

# Optional make wrappers
make test-quick   # Fast tests (~10s) - for development iteration
make test         # Full suite (615 tests, ~80s)
make test-cov     # Full suite with coverage report
```
