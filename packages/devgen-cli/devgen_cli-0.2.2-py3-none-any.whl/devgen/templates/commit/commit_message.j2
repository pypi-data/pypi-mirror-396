2. A short summary paragraph if needed.
3. Bullet points listing the main changes, grouped as 'New Features', 'Enhancements & Refinements', and 'Bug Fixes' if relevant. Use bold for feature/section names.
{% if use_emoji %}
4. Use appropriate emojis for the commit type and sections (e.g., 🚀 for features, 🐛 for bugs).
{% else %}
4. Do NOT use any emojis in the commit message.
{% endif %}
