Directory Validator is a Python utility that creates and verifies a unique hash stamp for a directory. This stamp, saved as a JSON file, represents the directory’s structure (relative paths, excluding the stamp file itself), allowing you to quickly detect changes in the directory layout.

## 🛠 Features

- **Stamp Creation:** Generate a deterministic SHA-256 hash from all relative paths (files and subdirectories).
- **Validation:** Recalculate the hash to determine if any files or directories have changed.
- **Exclusion Handling:** Automatically ignores the stamp file (`directory_stemp.json`) in the directory root.
- **Simple CLI Interface:** Easily create or validate stamps via command-line options.

## 📥 Installation

Install Directory Validator directly from **PyPI**:

```bash
pip install dirval
```

For a user-local installation (recommended if you don’t use virtual environments):

```bash
pip install --user dirval
```

For development or editable installs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/directory-validator.git
cd directory-validator
pip install -e .
```

After installation, the `dirval` command will be available in your shell.

## 🚀 Usage

### Create a Directory Stamp

Generate a stamp (hash and timestamp) for a directory.
The stamp is saved as `directory_stemp.json` inside the directory.

```bash
dirval <path_to_directory> --stamp
```

Example:

```bash
dirval ./my-folder --stamp
```

### Validate a Directory

Compare the current directory state against the stored stamp to check for any modifications.

```bash
dirval <path_to_directory> --validate
```

Example:

```bash
dirval ./my-folder --validate
```

Exit codes:

* `0` → directory matches the stored stamp
* `1` → directory has changed
* `3` → directory or stamp file not found

## 📖 How It Works

* The tool recursively walks through the given directory and collects all file and subdirectory paths.
* The stamp file (`directory_stemp.json`) in the directory root is ignored automatically.
* All collected relative paths are sorted deterministically.
* A cumulative SHA-256 hash is generated from those paths.
* The hash and a timestamp are stored in `directory_stemp.json`.
* During validation, the hash is recalculated and compared against the stored value.
