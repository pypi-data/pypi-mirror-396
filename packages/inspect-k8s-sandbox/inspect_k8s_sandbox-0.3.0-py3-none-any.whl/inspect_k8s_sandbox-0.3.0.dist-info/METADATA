Welcome to the `k8s_sandbox` plugin for [Inspect](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/). It
provides a Kubernetes (K8s) sandbox environment in which agentic evaluations can
securely be run at scale.

We are releasing this publicly because it is a useful example of a complex Sandbox
Environment provider. While this work was designed within the context of UK AISI's
infrastructure, we do expect it to be useful to other organisations if they adopt some
of our conventions. If you have an existing Kubernetes cluster this provider may work
for you, or may require further tailoring and adaptation. To ask questions or discuss
adopting this plugin, come join us in the [Inspect
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/inspectcommunity/shared_invite/zt-2w9eaeusj-4Hu~IBHx2aORsKz~njuz4g)!

You can find documentation at
[https://k8s-sandbox.aisi.org.uk/](https://k8s-sandbox.aisi.org.uk/).

If you’d like to contribute to the development of the plugin, please review our
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before raising a pull request.
