# Changelog

## Unreleased to PyPI

## 2025-11-28 0.3.0

- Increase files open limit if necessary
- Migrate to uv
- Add (ignored) concurrency param to exec
- Support `network_mode: none` in Docker Compose files
- Support `x-default` service key in Docker Compose files
- **Breaking**: When converting multi-service Docker Compose files without an explicit
  default, the first service (in YAML order) is now renamed to `default`. This ensures
  consistent default service resolution regardless of Kubernetes pod ordering.
- **Breaking**: Add validation for null values in Helm values files (Helm 4 silently filters out null values from maps during template processing, which can cause unexpected behavior)

## 2025-09-25 0.2.0

- First release to Pypi
- Ignore `x-local` key in Docker Compose files (Inspect-specific extension).
- Enhanced `additionalResources` to support full Helm templating.
- Support `user` parameter on `K8sSandboxEnvironment.exec()` (only when container is running as root and `runuser` is installed).
- Support `user` parameter on `K8sSandboxEnvironment.connection()` (returns `SandboxConnection`).
- Add `SandboxConnection` support for human agent baselining and connecting to a sandbox for debugging.
- Add support for specifying a kubeconfig context name in K8sSandboxEnvironmentConfig.
- Add automatic translation of Docker Compose files to Helm values files.
- Handle cancellation of evals (either manually or due to an error) such that Helm releases are uninstalled.
- Increase default Helm install timeout from 5 to 10 minutes.
- For "helm install timeout" errors, add link to docs within and include instructions on increasing timeout within the error message.
- Ignore "release not found" errors when uninstalling Helm charts (expected when helm release was not successfully installed).
- Prevent DNS exfiltration attacks by limiting which domains can be looked up (when using the built-in Helm chart).
- If a namespace is not includes in the kubeconfig context, default to a namespace named "default".
- Add `CLUSTER_DEFAULT` magic string for `runtimeClassName` which will remove the field from the pod spec.
- Add ignored `timeout_retry` parameter to `exec()` method.
- Always capture the output of `helm uninstall` so that errors can contain meaningful information.
- Add support for `inspect sandbox cleanup k8s` command to uninstall all Inspect Helm charts.
- Remove use of Inspect's deleted `SANDBOX` log level in favour of `trace_action()` and `trace_message()` functions.
- Initial release.
