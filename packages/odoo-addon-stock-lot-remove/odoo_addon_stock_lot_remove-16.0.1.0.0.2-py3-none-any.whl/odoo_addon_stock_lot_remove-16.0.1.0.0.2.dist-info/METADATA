This addon allows to automatically remove stock quants with a past
removal date, regardless of whether they are reserved or not.

On each warehouse, you can enable the automatic removal of lots with a
past removal date.

Every day, for each warehouse where the automatic removal is enabled, a
cron job will launch the process to remove past removal date quants.

Use Cases / Context
===================

BUSINESS NEED:

On large warehouses, it is common to have products with a limited shelf
life, such as food or pharmaceuticals. These products need to be managed
carefully to avoid waste and ensure compliance with regulations. One of
the challenges is to ensure that lots with a past removal date are
automatically removed from the stock whatever they are reserved or not.

APPROACH: This module addresses this need by identifying past removal
date lots in the stock, dereserving them, and creating a specific
picking to remove them from the stock. The past removal date lots are
then reserved in the picking and an attempt is made to reserve again the
dereserved moves.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to to enable the removal of expired
lots. This can be done by following these steps:

- Go to *App* > Inventory > Settings -> Warehouses
- Select the warehouse you want to configure.
- On the 'Warehouse Configuration' page, find the section 'Expired Lots
  Auto Move'.
- Check the box 'Enable Expired Lot Auto Remove'.

Usage
=====

On the warehouse form, once the 'Enable Expired Lot Auto Remove'
checkbox is checked, some additional fields will appear to configure the
automatic removal of past removal date quants:

- 'Expired Lot Origin Location': This field allows you to select the
  origin location from which the past removal date quants will be
  removed. It is a required field. (Defaults to the warehouse's stock
  location)
- 'Expired Lot Destination Location': This field allows you to select
  the destination location where the past removal date quants will be
  moved. It is a required field. (Defaults to the warehouse's quality
  control location)
- 'Expired Lot Move Picking Type': This field allows you to select the
  picking type that will be used for the automatic removal of past
  removal date quants. It is a required field. (Defaults to the
  warehouse's 'Expired Lot Removal' picking type)
