BUSINESS NEED: 

On large warehouses, it is common to have products with a limited shelf life, such as food or pharmaceuticals. These products need to be managed carefully to avoid waste and ensure compliance with regulations. One of the challenges is to
ensure that lots with a past removal date are automatically removed from the stock whatever they are reserved or not.

APPROACH:
This module addresses this need by identifying past removal date lots in the stock, dereserving them, and creating a specific picking to remove them from the stock. The past removal date lots are then reserved in the picking and an attempt is made to reserve again the dereserved moves.
