This addon allows to automatically remove stock quants with a past removal date, regardless of whether they are reserved or not. 

On each warehouse, you can enable the automatic removal of lots with a past removal date.

Every day, for each warehouse where the automatic removal is enabled, a cron job will launch the process to remove past removal date quants.
