## Overview

`pylifemap` is a Python package for visualizing taxonomy data on [Lifemap](https://lifemap.cnrs.fr), the interactive tree of life. It provides several visualisation layers, as well as functions allowing to aggregate data along the tree branches.

For examples, installation and usage instructions, see the [documentation website](https://lifemap-tol.github.io/pylifemap).

## Credits

- Visualizations are powered by [Open Layers](https://openlayers.org), [deck.gl](https://deck.gl), [d3](https://d3js.org) and [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/).
- The widget is developed thanks to the [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev) framework.
