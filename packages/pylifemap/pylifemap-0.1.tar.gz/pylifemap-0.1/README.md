## Overview

`pylifemap` is a Python package for visualizing taxonomy data on [Lifemap](https://lifemap.cnrs.fr), the interactive tree of life. It provides several visualisation layers, as well as functions allowing to aggregate data along the tree branches.

For examples, installation and usage instructions, see the [documentation website](https://lifemap-tol.github.io/pylifemap).
