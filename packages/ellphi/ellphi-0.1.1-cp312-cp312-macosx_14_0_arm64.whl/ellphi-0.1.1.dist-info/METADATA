# EllPHi – a fast ellipse-tangency solver for anisotropic persistent homology

**EllPHi** brings anisotropy to persistent-homology workflows.

Starting from an ordinary point cloud, it estimates local covariance, inflates **ellipsoids** instead of balls, and feeds the resulting *tangency distance* into your favourite PH backend (HomCloud, Ripser, and so on). The result: cleaner barcodes, longer lifetimes, and ring structures that survive heavy noise — all without rewriting your topology code.

## Features

- **Ellipse Creation**: Easily create ellipses from covariance matrices or directly from point cloud neighborhoods.
- **Tangency Distance**: Compute the tangency distance between pairs of ellipses, a key component for anisotropic persistent homology.
- **High-Performance Backend**: Includes a C++ backend for fast and efficient tangency calculations, with a pure Python fallback for portability.
- **N-Dimensional Support**: Works with n-dimensional ellipsoids, allowing for analysis in higher-dimensional spaces.
- **Visualization**: Comes with helper functions to quickly visualize ellipse clouds using Matplotlib.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ellphi
```

To install with demo dependencies for notebooks and examples:

```bash
pip install ellphi[demo]
```

## Supported Python Versions

Python 3.10 or later.

## Quick start

Install and solve a tangency query in just a few lines:

```bash
pip install ellphi
```

```python
import numpy as np
import ellphi

pcoef = ellphi.coef_from_cov([0.0, 0.0], [[0.2, 0.0], [0.0, 0.1]])[0]
qcoef = ellphi.coef_from_cov([1.0, 0.25], [[0.15, 0.0], [0.0, 0.25]])[0]

result = ellphi.tangency(pcoef, qcoef)
print(f"t = {result.t:.3f}")       # tangency distance
print(f"point = {result.point}")
```

## Usage

Here's a complete example of how to create an ellipse cloud from a point cloud and compute the pairwise tangency distances:

```python
import numpy as np
import ellphi

# 1. Generate a sample point cloud
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# 2. Create an ellipse cloud from the point cloud
# This will estimate the local covariance for each point's neighborhood
ellipses = ellphi.ellipse_cloud(X, k=5)

# 3. Compute the pairwise tangency distances
# This will use the C++ backend if available
distances = ellipses.pdist_tangency()

print("Computed tangency distances for", len(distances), "pairs of ellipses.")
```
