- **Downloading** Results from the YellowDog Object Store with the **`yd-download`** command
- **Finishing** Work Requirements with the **`yd-finish`** command
- **Following Event Streams** for Work Requirements, Worker Pools and Compute Requirements with the **`yd-follow`** command
- **Instantiating** Compute Requirements with the **`yd-instantiate`** command
- **Listing** YellowDog items using the **`yd-list`** command
- **Provisioning** Worker Pools with the **`yd-provision`** command
- **Resizing** Worker Pools and Compute Requirements with the **`yd-resize`** command
