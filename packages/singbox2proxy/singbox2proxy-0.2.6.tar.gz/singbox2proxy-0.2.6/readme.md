Integrate sing-box proxies into your python applications with ease on any device.

- sing-box auto-install & easy management
- zero dependencies for base functionality
- seamless integration with existing applications
- tuned for best performance and latency in mind

### Supported Protocols

This module supports these sing-box protocols:

- VMess (`vmess://`)
- VLESS (`vless://`)
- Shadowsocks (`ss://`)
- Trojan (`trojan://`)
- Hysteria2* (`hy2://`, `hysteria2://`)

*: Chaining as a middle proxy not supported, according to the [sing-box docs](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/inbound/)

### Installation

with pip

```shell
pip install singbox2proxy 
```

with [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/)

```shell
uv pip install singbox2proxy 
```

build from source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nichind/singbox2proxy.git
cd singbox2proxy
pip install -e .
```

or install directly from GitHub

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/nichind/singbox2proxy.git
```

### Python Usage

Using built-in client powered by [curl-cffi](https://pypi.org/project/curl-cffi/) or [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

```python
from singbox2proxy import SingBoxProxy

proxy = SingBoxProxy("vless://...")
response = proxy.request("GET", "https://api.ipify.org?format=json")  # IF curl-cffi is installed, it will be used; otherwise, requests will be used.
print(response.status_code, response.text)  # 200, {"ip":"..."}
```

Integrating with your own HTTP client

```python
import requests
from singbox2proxy import SingBoxProxy

proxy = SingBoxProxy("hy2://...")
session = requests.Session()
session.proxies = proxy.proxy_for_requests  # {"http": "http://127.0.0.1:<port>", "https": "http://127.0.0.1:<port>"}
response = session.get("https://api.ipify.org?format=json")
print(response.status_code, response.text)  # 200, {"ip":"..."}
```

Example with aiohttp

```python
from singbox2proxy import SingBoxProxy
import aiohttp

async def main():
    proxy = SingBoxProxy("vmess://...")
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(proxy=proxy.socks5_proxy_url or proxy.http_proxy_url) as session:
        async with session.get("https://api.ipify.org?format=json") as response:
            print(response.status, await response.text())  # 200, {"ip":"..."}
```

#### Chaining

Chained proxies allow you to route your traffic through multiple proxy servers if you'll ever need more privacy or easy restriction bypass. You can chain multiple proxies together by specifying a `chain_proxy` with a gate `SingBoxProxy` instance when creating a new `SingBoxProxy`.

> [!NOTE]
> See what protocols can be used as middleman proxies at [supported protocols](#supported-protocols)

```python
from singbox2proxy import SingBoxProxy

proxy1 = SingBoxProxy("vmess://...")
proxy2 = SingBoxProxy("vless://...", chain_proxy=proxy1)

response = proxy2.request("GET", "https://api.ipify.org?format=json")
print(response.status_code, response.text)  # 200, {"ip": "<proxy2's IP>"}
# Here, requests made through `proxy2` will first go through `proxy1`, then proxy1 will forward the request to proxy2, and finally proxy2 will send the request to the target server.
```

#### TUN Mode (System-Wide VPN)

Create a virtual network interface to route all system traffic through the proxy. This requires root/administrator privileges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Very experimental, use at your own risk.

```python
# Requires root/admin privileges
proxy = SingBoxProxy("vless://...", tun_enabled=True)

# All system traffic is now routed through the proxy
# Use like a normal VPN connection
```

#### Relay - Share Your Proxy Connection

Create a shareable proxy server that relays traffic through your existing proxy connection or provides direct internet access:

```python
from singbox2proxy import SingBoxProxy

# Relay through an existing proxy
proxy = SingBoxProxy(
    "vless://original-proxy-url",
    relay_protocol="ss",  # Protocol for the relay server
    relay_host="192.168.1.100",  # Your server's IP (auto-detected if not specified)
    relay_port=8443  # Port for the relay server (auto-assigned if not specified)
)

# Or create a direct connection relay (no proxy URL needed)
direct_relay = SingBoxProxy(
    None,  # No proxy - direct connection
    relay_protocol="ss",
    relay_host="my-server.com",
    relay_port=8443
)

# Get the shareable URL
print(f"Share this URL: {proxy.relay_url}")
# Output: ss://uuid@192.168.1.100:8443?type=tcp&security=none#singbox2proxy-relay

# Keep the proxy running
input("Press Enter to stop...")
proxy.stop()
```

**Supported protocols:** `vmess`, `trojan`, `ss`, `socks`, `http`

#### System Proxy Configuration

Automatically configure your OS proxy settings. This is a great alternative to TUN mode when you don't have root access.

> [!NOTE]
> The system proxy settings will be restored to their original state when the `SingBoxProxy` instance is closed or goes out of scope, but multiple instances may interfere with each other, may be better to backup your initial settings before using this feature.

```python
# Automatically sets system proxy and restores on exit
with SingBoxProxy("vless://...", set_system_proxy=True) as proxy:
    # Your web browser and other apps will now use the proxy
    print(f"System proxy configured to use {proxy.http_proxy_url}")
```

### CLI

> [!NOTE]
> If the `singbox2proxy` or `sb2p` command isn't working in your terminal, use `python -m singbox2proxy <command>`, `uv run -m singbox2proxy <command>`, etc. instead.

#### Basic Commands

Start a single proxy:

```shell
sb2p "vmess://eyJ2IjoiMiIsInBzIj..."
```

Specify custom ports:

```shell
sb2p "ss://..." --http-port 8080 --socks-port False  # Socks disabled
```

Test the proxy connection:

```shell
sb2p "trojan://..." --test
```

#### Proxy Chaining

Chain multiple proxies (traffic flows: you -> proxy1 -> proxy2 -> target):

```shell
sb2p "vmess://..." "vless://..." "hy2://..." --chain
```

> [!NOTE]
> See what protocols can be used as middleman proxies at [supported protocols](#supported-protocols)

The first URL becomes the entry point, and the last URL connects to the target server.

#### Relay - Share Your Proxy Connection

Create a shareable proxy server that relays traffic through your existing proxy connection, or provides direct internet access from your server:

```shell
# Relay through an existing proxy
sb2p "ss://original-proxy" --relay ss

# Direct connection relay (no proxy, just share your server's internet)
sb2p --relay ss

# Output includes a shareable URL:
#   Relay URL: vless://uuid@your-ip:port?type=tcp&security=none#singbox2proxy-relay
#   Share this URL to relay traffic through your server
```

Supported relay protocols: `vmess`, `trojan`, `ss`/`shadowsocks`, `socks`, `http`

Custom host and port:

```shell
sb2p "ss://..." --relay ss --relay-host "myserver.com" --relay-port 8443

# Direct connection with custom settings
sb2p --relay ss --relay-host "myserver.com" --relay-port 8443
```

#### Configuration Management

Generate configuration without starting:

```shell
sb2p "vless://..." --config-only
```

Save configuration to file:

```shell
sb2p "vmess://..." --output-config config.json
```

#### Logging Options

Enable verbose logging:

```shell
sb2p "ss://..." --verbose
```

Disable all logging:

```shell
sb2p "hy2://..." --quiet
```

#### TUN Mode (System-Wide VPN)

Enable TUN mode to route all system traffic through the proxy.

```shell
# Linux/macOS (requires sudo)
sudo sb2p "vless://..." --tun

# Windows (run as Administrator)
sb2p "vless://..." --tun
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Very experimental, use at your own risk.

#### System Proxy

Automatically configure your OS to use the proxy.

```shell
# Set system proxy on start, restore on stop
sb2p "vless://..." --set-system-proxy
```

> [!NOTE]
> The system proxy settings will be restored to their original state when the `SingBoxProxy` instance is closed or goes out of scope, but multiple instances may interfere with each other, may be better to backup your initial settings before using this feature.
