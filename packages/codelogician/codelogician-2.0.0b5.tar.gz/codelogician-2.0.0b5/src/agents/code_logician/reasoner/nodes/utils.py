context_on_src_iml_correspondence = """IML (Imandra Modeling Language) is a formalized \
subset of OCaml designed for automated reasoning and formal verification. When working \
with IML, we create a formal model that corresponds to the original source code. This \
model preserves the core logic and behavior while adding mathematical rigor.

The correspondence between source code and IML is typically one-to-one at the function \
level - each important function in the source has a corresponding function in IML. \
This parallel structure allows us to reason about and verify properties of the \
original code through analysis of its formal IML model."""
