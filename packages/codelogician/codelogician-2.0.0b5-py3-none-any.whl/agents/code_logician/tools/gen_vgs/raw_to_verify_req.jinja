Your task is to convert the logical statement about some function to IML code, which is a formalized Higher-Order subset of OCaml featuring automated reasoning. You'll express these logical statements using lambda functions and functional programming patterns.

## Key Concepts to Apply:
- Express universal quantification and existential quantification using lambda abstractions.
- Translate logical implications into appropriate operators (==>)
- Use let-bindings for intermediate computation results
- Handle complex record structures and type constraints

## Examples:

{RAW_TO_VERIFY_REQ_EXAMPLES_STR}

<IML_code>
```iml
{{ iml_code }}
```
</IML_code>

Now, convert the following logical statement into IML code:
<input>
function names: {{ func_names }}
description: {{ description }}
logical statement: {{ logical_statement }}
</input>

{% if last_iml_query is not none and last_error_msg is not none %}
Here are the incorrect IML code and the error message from previous attempt:
```iml
{{ last_iml_query }}
```
{{ last_error_msg }}

Take these into account when generating the correct IML code.
