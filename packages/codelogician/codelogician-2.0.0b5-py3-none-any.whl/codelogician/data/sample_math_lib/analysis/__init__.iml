(* Analysis package for advanced mathematical computations. *)

(* Note: This is a module/package definition file that only contains imports and exports.
   In IML, we don't have a direct equivalent of Python's package __init__.py structure.
   The actual implementations would be in separate files (numerical.iml, optimization.iml).
   This file serves as documentation of the package structure. *)

(* The following would typically be defined in separate modules:
   - derivatives (from numerical module)
   - integration (from numerical module)  
   - root_finding (from optimization module)
*)
