> **⚠️ Active Development Notice**: This codebase is under active development. APIs and components may change, and some may be moved to separate repositories. Documentation may be incomplete or reference features still in development.

> **📄 Research Paper**: This project was first introduced and developed for the D2E project. For more details, see [D2E: Scaling Vision-Action Pretraining on Desktop Data for Transfer to Embodied AI](https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/). If you find this work useful, please cite our paper.

## Quick Start

> 💡 This is a conceptual overview. See the [Quick Start Guide](https://open-world-agents.github.io/open-world-agents/quick-start/) for detailed instructions.

<!-- SYNC-ID: quick-start-3-steps -->
```bash
# 1. Record desktop interaction
$ ocap my-session.mcap

# 2. Process to training format
$ python scripts/01_raw_to_event.py --train-dir ./

# 3. Train your model (coming soon)
$ python train.py --dataset ./event-dataset
```
<!-- END-SYNC: quick-start-3-steps -->

## Installation

```bash
# For video recording, install GStreamer first. Skip if you only need data processing.
$ conda install open-world-agents::gstreamer-bundle

# Install OWA
$ pip install owa
```

## Core Components

<!-- SYNC-ID: core-components-list -->
- 🌍 **[Environment Framework](https://open-world-agents.github.io/open-world-agents/env/)**: "USB-C of desktop agents" - universal interface for native desktop automation with pre-built plugins for desktop control, high-performance screen capture, and zero-configuration plugin system
- 📊 **[Data Infrastructure](https://open-world-agents.github.io/open-world-agents/data/)**: Complete desktop agent data pipeline from recording to training with `OWAMcap` format - a [universal standard](https://open-world-agents.github.io/open-world-agents/data/getting-started/why-owamcap/) powered by [MCAP](https://mcap.dev/)
- 🛠️ **[CLI Tools](https://open-world-agents.github.io/open-world-agents/cli/)**: Command-line utilities (`owl`) for recording, analyzing, and managing agent data
- 🤖 **[Examples](https://open-world-agents.github.io/open-world-agents/examples/)**: Complete implementations and training pipelines for multimodal agents
