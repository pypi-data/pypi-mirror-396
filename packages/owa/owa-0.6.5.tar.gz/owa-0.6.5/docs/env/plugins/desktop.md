    # Monitor events
    with LISTENERS["desktop/keyboard"]().configure(callback=on_key).session:
        with LISTENERS["desktop/mouse"]().configure(callback=on_mouse).session:
            input("Press Enter to stop monitoring...")
    ```

=== "Window Management"
    ```python
    from owa.core import CALLABLES

    # Get window information
    active = CALLABLES["desktop/window.get_active_window"]()
    print(f"Active window: {active}")

    # Find specific window
    window = CALLABLES["desktop/window.get_window_by_title"]("Notepad")
    if window:
        print(f"Found Notepad: {window}")
    ```

## Technical Details

### Library Selection Rationale

This module uses `pynput` for input simulation after evaluating several alternatives:

- [PyAutoGUI](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui) uses deprecated Windows APIs (`keybd_event/mouse_event`) instead of modern `SendInput`, which fail in DirectX applications and games. Additionally, PyAutoGUI has seen limited maintenance (last significant update was over 2 years ago).

- [pydirectinput](https://github.com/learncodebygaming/pydirectinput) and [pydirectinput_rgx](https://github.com/ReggX/pydirectinput_rgx) use `SendInput` but lack input capturing capabilities.

- [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) and [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) libraries have unresolved bugs that impact reliability.

### Raw Mouse Input

`mouse` captures screen cursor position (x, y) after Windows applies pointer acceleration. `mouse/raw` captures hardware movement deltas (dx, dy) before acceleration, directly from the HID device.

Games lock the cursor to screen center and read raw input for camera control, so `mouse` position stays constant while `mouse/raw` captures actual player movements. Most OWA datasets use `mouse/raw` for this reason.

### Key Auto-Repeat Functionality

Key auto-repeat is a Windows feature where holding down a key generates multiple key events after an initial delay. When a user presses and holds a key, Windows first waits for the repeat delay period, then generates repeated `WM_KEYDOWN` messages at intervals determined by the repeat rate.

**How Windows auto-repeat works:**

1. Initial key press: First `WM_KEYDOWN` message is sent immediately with repeat count = 1
2. Repeat delay: System waits for the configured delay (typically 250-1000ms)
3. Repeated events: Additional `WM_KEYDOWN` messages are sent at the repeat rate interval (typically 30ms)
4. Repeat count: Each repeated message includes an incremented repeat count in the message parameters

System configuration via `SystemParametersInfo`:

- Repeat delay: Time before auto-repeat begins (0-3 scale, maps to 250ms-1000ms, default: 500ms)
- Repeat rate: Frequency of repeated characters (0-31 scale, maps to ~30ms-500ms intervals, default: 30ms)

- [SystemParametersInfo Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-systemparametersinfoa)

**Using OWA's `press_repeat` function:**

```python
CALLABLES["desktop/keyboard.press_repeat"](key, press_time: float, initial_delay: float = 0.5, repeat_delay: float = 0.033)
```

Parameters:

- `key`: The key to press and repeat
- `press_time`: Total duration to hold the key (seconds)
- `initial_delay`: Time before repeating starts (default: 0.5s, matches Windows default)
- `repeat_delay`: Interval between repeated keypresses (default: 0.033s ≈ 30ms, matches Windows default)

**Differences from true Windows auto-repeat:**

The `press_repeat` function approximates Windows auto-repeat behavior but isn't identical:

- OS auto-repeat: `WM_KEYDOWN` messages include repeat flag (bit 30) and repeat count
- OWA implementation: Multiple `WM_KEYDOWN` messages without repeat flags (each appears as individual key press)

The difference is small and commonly ignored by applications, making this approach effective for most automation scenarios.

Why the difference exists: Windows provides repeat detection through `WM_KEYDOWN` message parameters, but pynput does not expose these Windows-specific details. Since the primary use case is triggering repeat behavior rather than detecting it, this limitation doesn't affect the functionality.

Reference: [WM_KEYDOWN Message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-keydown)

**Windows repeat count behavior:**

The `WM_KEYDOWN` repeat count (bits 0-15) behaves differently than many developers expect:

- Not cumulative: Each message contains the repeat count since the last processed `WM_KEYDOWN`, not a running total
- Usually 1: In typical applications with fast message processing, the repeat count is almost always 1
- Higher values possible: Only occurs when message processing is slow enough for multiple repeats to queue up

Example: If you hold a key and your message loop processes messages quickly, you'll receive multiple `WM_KEYDOWN` messages each with repeat count = 1. Only when processing is delayed (e.g., by adding `Sleep(1000)` in the handler) will you see higher repeat counts like 20-30.

This design allows responsive applications to process key events immediately rather than waiting for the key release.
