        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        Preamble
        
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
        and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
        guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
        software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to
        most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
        authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
        covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply
        it to your programs, too.
        
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
        Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
        freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
        if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
        that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
        and that you know you can do these things.
        
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
        deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
        translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
        software, or if you modify it.
        
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
        for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
        You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
        And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
        
        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
        (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
        distribute and/or modify the software.
        
        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
        everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
        If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
        recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
        problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
        original authors' reputations.
        
        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
        individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
        To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
        everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
        
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
        and modification follow.
        
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
        
        0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
        placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
        of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
        program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
        or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
        the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
        without limitation in the term "modification".)
        Each licensee is addressed as "you".
        
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
        by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
        is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
        contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
        made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on
        what the Program does.
        
        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
        as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
        disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
        License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
        of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
        
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
        may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
        
        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
        thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
        modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
        also meet all of these conditions:
        
            a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        
            b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
            or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
            to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
            the terms of this License.
        
            c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
            you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
            most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
            appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
            (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
            redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
            to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
            interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
            based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
        
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
        sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
        considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
        and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
        separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
        which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
        on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
        to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
        regardless of who wrote it.
        
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
        rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
        the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
        works based on the Program.
        
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
        the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
        or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
        the scope of this License.
        
        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
            a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
            code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
            on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
        
            b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
            give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
            performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
            corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
            Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
            for software interchange; or,
        
            c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
            distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
            for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
            object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
            with Subsection b above.)
        
        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
        modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
        the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
        definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
        installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
        code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
        (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
        and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
        component itself accompanies the executable.
        
        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
        copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
        source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
        even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
        along with the object code.
        
        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
        expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
        sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
        your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
        or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        
        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
        However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
        Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
        do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
        (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing
        or modifying the Program or works based on it.
        
        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
        the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
        to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
        and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
        exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
        compliance by third parties to this License.
        
        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
        that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
        the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
        For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
        of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
        through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
        would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
        
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
        particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
        and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
        
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
        or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
        this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
        software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
        Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
        distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
        that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
        cannot impose that choice.
        
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
        consequence of the rest of this License.
        
        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
        countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
        copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
        geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
        distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
        In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written
        in the body of this License.
        
        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
        General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
        in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
        new problems or concerns.
        
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
        "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the
        Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
        this License, you may choose any version ever published
        by the Free Software Foundation.
        
        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
        whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
        permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
        write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
        Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
        all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
        and reuse of software generally.
        
        NO WARRANTY
        
        11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
        THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
        STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
        PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
        YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        
        12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
        ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
        THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
        OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
        OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
        OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
        use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
        which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
        them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
        of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
        pointer to where the full notice is found.
        
            One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
            Copyright (C) {{ year }} {{ organization }}
        
            This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
            under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
            Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.
        
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
            WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
            or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
            See the GNU General Public License for more details.
        
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
            with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
            59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
        
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
        it starts in an interactive mode:
        
            Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision
            comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is
            free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
            conditions; type `show c' for details.
        
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
        called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
        mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
        
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
        Here is a sample; alter the names:
        
            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
            `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
        proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
        consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
        the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
        Public License instead of this License.

   Many-body analysis on top of Quantum ESPRESSO calculations   
</pre>
</div>


## Introduction
This python package provides an interface between the [Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) DFT software and many-body calculations. We extract the Kohn-Sham orbitals from a QE calculation to construct a many-body Hamiltonian and solve it using classical and quantum algorithms. Classical solvers are implemented using the [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/) package. Quantum solvers are implemented using the [TenCirChem](https://tensorcircuit.github.io/TenCirChem-NG/index.html) and [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) packages. After this we can calculate Bader charges on all atoms in the computational cell using the charge density and the [Bader charge analysis code](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/).

Dopyqo reads the output files of a QE calculation to build the Hamiltonian. The needed files are located in the .save folder that QE outputs and are the `data-file-schema.xml` and the `wfc.dat` or `wfc.hdf5` files.

## Installation
Install via pip using
```bash
pip install dopyqo
```

To use a [more performant rust implementation for some matrix element calculations](https://github.com/dlr-wf/dopyqo-rs) you can install
```bash
pip install dopyqo-rs
```
or
```bash
pip install dopyqo[rs]
```
For this you need the following installed on your machine:
- [Rust programming language](https://rustup.rs/)
- [GNU scientific library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). On a debian (or debian-derived) OS ask your admin to run `sudo apt install libgsl-dev`.

If `dopyqo-rs` is not installed, a slower python implementation using numpy and scipy is used.

Further, `Dopyqo` can utilize GPUs for performing FFTs using the [`cupy`](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/index.html) package to calculate matrix elements related to the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs):
```bash
pip install cupy
```
or
```bash
pip install dopyqo[cupy]
```
For this make sure to install the correct `cupy` version matching your installed CUDA version.
If `cupy` is not installed, a python implementation using numpy is used. If `cupy` is installed, the python implementation can still be used by setting `use_gpu=False` in the `dopyqo.DopyqoConfig`.


## Usage

`Dopyqo` can be used via a python interface:
```python
import os
import dopyqo

config = dopyqo.DopyqoConfig(
    base_folder=os.path.join("path/to/your/qe/calculation"),
    prefix="PrefixUsedInYourQECalculiaton",
    active_electrons=2,
    active_orbitals=4,
    run_fci=True, # Solve ground state with PySCF FCI solver
    run_vqe=True, # Solve ground state with VQE solver
    use_qiskit=False, # If False use TenCirChem to simulate the VQE, if True use Qiskit
    vqe_optimizer=dopyqo.VQEOptimizers.L_BFGS_B,
    vqe_excitations=dopyqo.ExcitationPools.SINGLES_DOUBLES,
    n_threads=10,
)
energy_dict, wfc_obj, h_ks, mats = dopyqo.run(config)
```
This reads the output of the specified QE calculation (`base_folder` and `prefix`), computes the many-body Hamiltonian, and solves for the ground-state using a FCI and VQE calculation in an active space of two electrons in four orbitals.

Alternatively, you can use the providend script called `dopyqo` and provide an input file in the toml format:
```bash
dopyqo -i your_input_file.toml
```
For information about the input file see [INPUT.md](INPUT.md). The latter currently provides only part of the functionality. Therefore, we encourage the use of the python interface.

See the [examples](examples/) folder for example scripts and an example input toml-file.

## Requirements
- Tested Python version: `3.11`
- Tested QE version: `7.1` compiled with and without HDF5 `1.14.0`
- Tested with QE SCF calculations. General k-point calculations only work when using Qiskit or PySCF. Gamma-only calculations also work with TenCirChem.
- Only norm-conserving pseudopotentials are currently supported.
- Only spin-restricted QE calculations are currently supported.
- To calculate Bader charges, the [Bader charge analysis code](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/) needs to be installed.
- See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for required Python packages.


## Issues
### VQE calculation takes a lot of CPU resources
If using Linux set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to limit the number of used CPU threads.
