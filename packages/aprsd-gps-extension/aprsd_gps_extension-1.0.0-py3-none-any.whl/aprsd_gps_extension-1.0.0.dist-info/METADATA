           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

# Features

-   Connect to GPSD (GPS daemon) to retrieve GPS coordinates
-   Support for local and remote GPSD servers
-   Automatic APRS beaconing based on GPS position
-   Smart beaconing that sends beacons when the device moves a certain distance
-   Interval-based beaconing for regular position updates
-   Real-time GPS data polling and processing

# Requirements

-   `aprsd >= 4.2.4`
-   A running GPSD daemon (either local or remote)
-   GPSD must be accessible via TCP/IP on the configured host and port

# Installation

You can install *APRSD GPSD Extension* via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

``` console
$ pip install aprsd-gps-extension
```

Or using `uv`:

``` console
$ uv pip install aprsd-gps-extension
```

# Configuration

Before using the GPS extension, you need to configure it in your APRSD configuration file.
Generate a sample configuration file if you haven't already:

``` console
$ aprsd sample-config
```

This will create a configuration file at `~/.config/aprsd/aprsd.conf` (or `aprsd.yml`).

## GPSD Connection Settings

Add the following section to your APRSD configuration file to configure the GPS extension:

``` yaml
[aprsd_gps_extension]
# Enable the GPS extension (default: True)
enabled = True

# GPSD host to connect to (default: localhost)
# For remote GPSD, specify the IP address or hostname
gpsd_host = localhost

# GPSD port to connect to (default: 2947)
gpsd_port = 2947

# Polling interval in seconds to get GPS data (default: 2)
polling_interval = 2

# Enable debug logging (default: False)
debug = False
```

### Connecting to a Remote GPSD Server

To connect to a remote GPSD server, simply set the `gpsd_host` to the IP address or hostname
of the remote server:

``` yaml
[aprsd_gps_extension]
enabled = True
gpsd_host = 192.168.1.100  # Remote GPSD server IP
gpsd_port = 2947            # Default GPSD port
polling_interval = 2
```

**Important**: Ensure that:
1. The remote GPSD server is running and accessible
2. The GPSD port (default 2947) is not blocked by a firewall
3. Your GPS device is connected and providing data to GPSD on the remote server

## Beacon Configuration

The GPS extension supports three beaconing modes:

### No Beaconing (`none`)

The extension will fetch GPS data but won't send any beacons. This is useful if you only
want to track GPS position without broadcasting it.

``` yaml
[aprsd_gps_extension]
beacon_type = none
```

### Interval Beaconing (`interval`)

Sends a beacon at regular intervals regardless of movement.

``` yaml
[aprsd_gps_extension]
beacon_type = interval
beacon_interval = 1800  # Send beacon every 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
```

### Smart Beaconing (`smart`)

Sends beacons only when the device has moved a certain distance or after a time window.
This is more efficient and reduces unnecessary beacons when stationary.

``` yaml
[aprsd_gps_extension]
beacon_type = smart
smart_beacon_distance_threshold = 50   # Send beacon after moving 50 meters
smart_beacon_time_window = 60           # Send beacon if stationary for 60 seconds
```

## Complete Configuration Example

Here's a complete example configuration for connecting to a remote GPSD server with smart beaconing:

``` yaml
[aprsd_gps_extension]
enabled = True
gpsd_host = 192.168.1.100
gpsd_port = 2947
polling_interval = 2
debug = False
beacon_type = smart
beacon_interval = 1800
smart_beacon_distance_threshold = 50
smart_beacon_time_window = 60
```

## Enabling Beaconing

The GPS extension requires that APRSD beaconing is enabled in the main configuration:

``` yaml
[DEFAULT]
enable_beacon = True
beacon_interval = 1800
beacon_symbol = /
```

# Usage

Once installed and configured, the GPS extension will automatically start when you run
`aprsd server` or `aprsd webchat` (if the webchat extension is installed).

The extension will:
1. Connect to the configured GPSD server
2. Poll GPS data at the specified interval
3. Send beacons according to the configured beacon type
4. Provide GPS statistics via the APRSD stats system

You can verify the GPS extension is working by checking the logs for messages like:

```
INFO: Connecting to GPS daemon: 192.168.1.100:2947
INFO: Connected to GPS daemon
INFO: GPS fix acquired
```
