The two dump files, generated with `--exclude "tests/**,**/test_*"` and `--exclude "**/test**"` respectively, are functionally identical.

Both commands resulted in the exclusion of the same 41 files. The only differences observed were the `Generated` timestamp and the SHA256 checksum, which are expected to vary with each run.

This indicates that for the current project structure, both exclusion patterns effectively achieve the same outcome of excluding the `tests/` directory and any files starting with `test_`.
