# User wants "users that want nothing to do with it to not deal with it".
# If we enable by default, they get the binary bloat.
# If we disable by default, the user (cosmicbull) needs to build with `--features telemetry`.
# Given "I have it in my enviornment", let's make it optional but enabled by default for the *dev* build, 
# but allows producing a clean build.
# ACTUALLY: For now, I will enable it by default so the current flow doesn't break.
