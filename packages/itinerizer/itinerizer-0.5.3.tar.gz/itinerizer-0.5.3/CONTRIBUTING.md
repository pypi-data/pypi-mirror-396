## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/itinerizer/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - System information (OS, Python version, etc.)
   - Error messages and stack traces

### Suggesting Features

1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Create a new issue with the "enhancement" label
3. Describe the feature and its use case
4. Provide examples if possible

### Contributing Code

1. Find an issue to work on or create a new one
2. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
3. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes following our coding standards
5. Write or update tests as needed
6. Update documentation if necessary
7. Commit your changes with clear messages

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with these specifications:
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for all functions
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Code Formatting

We use Black for code formatting:
```bash
black src/ tests/
```

### Linting

We use Flake8 for linting:
```bash
flake8 src/ tests/
```

### Type Checking

We use MyPy for type checking:
```bash
mypy src/
```

### Import Order

1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local application imports

Each group should be separated by a blank line.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=itinerizer --cov-report=html
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_models.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Place end-to-end tests in `tests/e2e/`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use fixtures for common test data

Example test:
```python
def test_itinerary_creation_with_valid_data():
    """Test that an itinerary can be created with valid data."""
    # Arrange
    title = "Tokyo Business Trip"
    start_date = date(2025, 3, 15)
    end_date = date(2025, 3, 22)
    travelers = [create_test_traveler()]
    
    # Act
    itinerary = Itinerary(
        title=title,
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        travelers=travelers
    )
    
    # Assert
    assert itinerary.title == title
    assert itinerary.start_date == start_date
    assert len(itinerary.travelers) == 1
```

## Documentation

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:
```python
def calculate_total_price(segments: List[Segment]) -> Optional[Money]:
    """Calculate the total price from a list of segments.
    
    Args:
        segments: List of travel segments
        
    Returns:
        Total price as Money object, or None if no prices
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If segments have mixed currencies
    """
```

### README Updates

- Adding new features
