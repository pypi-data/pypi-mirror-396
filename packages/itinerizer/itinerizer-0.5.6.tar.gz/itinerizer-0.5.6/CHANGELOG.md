## [0.5.2] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed overlap validation to support realistic business travel scenarios
- Implemented smart segment categorization:
  - **Background segments** (hotels): Can overlap with any other segments
  - **Foreground segments** (meetings/activities): Can overlap with hotels and each other (with warnings)
  - **Exclusive segments** (flights/transfers): Cannot overlap with each other
- The library now properly handles multi-day hotel stays with meetings and activities during the stay

### Changed
- Complete rewrite of `ItineraryValidator._validate_segment_order()` method
- Hotels no longer conflict with flights, transfers, meetings, or activities
- Only transportation segments (flights/transfers) are validated for mutual exclusivity
- Meeting/activity overlaps generate warnings instead of errors

### Impact
- Resolves the major limitation that made the library unsuitable for real-world business travel
- Enables proper modeling of typical business trips with hotels spanning multiple days
- Maintains safety by preventing impossible scenarios (overlapping flights)

## [0.5.1] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed infinite recursion bug in `FlightSegment.sync_times()` method
- **Critical**: Fixed infinite recursion bug in `HotelSegment.sync_dates()` method
- Changed validators from `mode='after'` to `mode='before'` to prevent re-validation loops
- Both segment types now properly sync their datetime fields without causing recursion

### Technical Details
- FlightSegment now syncs `start_datetime` with `departure_datetime` during initialization
- HotelSegment now syncs `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` from check-in/out dates during initialization
- Validation still ensures arrival times are after departure times

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-11
