# p2f_HydrateCalcLib

A Python Library for the Prediction of Natural Gas Hydrate Equilibrium and Inhibition. Developed by Karsten Kunneman in collaboration with Prof. Amadeu K. Sum at the Colorado School of Mines

Version 0.1.0.9 - 2025/12/12

This tool is designed to determine the equilibrium conditions for a given single- or multiple-component hydrate system, including systems in the presence of inhibitors (alcohols, glycols, and salts).

This tool is based primarily on the following models:

- Phase behavior of clathrate hydrates: a model for single and multiple gas component hydrates by J. B. Klauda and S. I. Sandler [doi: 10.1021/ie000322b]
- Universal correlation for gas hydrates suppression temperature of inhibited systems: III. salts and organic inhibitors by Y. Hu, J.-H. Sa, B. R. Lee, and A. K. Sum [doi: 10.1002/aic.16369]
