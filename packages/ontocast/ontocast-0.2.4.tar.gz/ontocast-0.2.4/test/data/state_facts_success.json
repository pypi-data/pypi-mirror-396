Apple Inc.\n\n## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Preparation\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively 'Apple' or the 'Company'). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect  all  adjustments,  which  are  normal  and  recurring  in  nature,  necessary  for  fair  financial  statement  presentation.  The  preparation  of  these  condensed consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\n\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nTo  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  or  other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\n\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into  forward  contracts,  cross-currency  swaps  or  other  instruments. The  Company  designates  these  instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value hedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debtrelated foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\n\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\n\nThe notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n\n|                                                             | April 1, 2023   | September 24, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:     |                 |                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                  | $ 51,119        | $ 102,670            |\n| Interest rate contracts                                     | $ 19,375        | $ 20,125             |\n| Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: |                 |                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                  | $ 111,696       | $ 185,381            |\n\nThe gross fair values of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n\n|                              | September 24, 2022                                        | September 24, 2022                                            | September 24, 2022   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|                              | Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges | Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges | Total Fair Value     |\n| Derivative assets : (1)      |                                                           |                                                               |                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts   | $ 4,317                                                   | $ 2,819                                                       | $ 7,136              |\n| Derivative liabilities : (2) |                                                           |                                                               |                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts   | $ 2,205                                                   | $ 2,547                                                       | $ 4,752              |\n| Interest rate contracts      | $ 1,367                                                   | $ -                                                           | $ 1,367              |\n\n(1) Derivative  assets  are  measured  using  Level  2  fair  value  inputs  and  are  included  in  other  current  assets  and  other  non-current  assets  in  the  Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company's gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually  established  thresholds.  To  further  limit  credit  risk,  the  Company  generally  enters  into  master  netting  arrangements  with  the  respective counterparties to the Company's derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n\n|                                               | April 1, 2023   | September 24, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Hedged assets/(liabilities):                  |                 |                      |\n| Current and non-current marketable securities | $ 14,651        | $ 13,378             |\n| Current and non-current term debt             | $ (18,249)      | $ (18,739)           |\n\n## Accounts Receivable\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\n\nAs of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company's cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\n\n## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.  The  Company  purchases  these  components  directly  from  suppliers.  As  of  April  1,  2023,  the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.\n\n## Note 4 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\n\nThe following tables show the Company's condensed consolidated financial statement details as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\n\n## Inventories\n\n|                   | April 1, 2023   | September 24, 2022   |\n|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Components        | $ 3,379         | $ 1,637              |\n| Finished goods    | 4,103           | 3,309                |\n| Total inventories | $ 7,482         | $ 4,946              |\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\n\n|                                           | April 1, 2023   | September 24, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Gross property, plant and equipment       | $ 113,066       | $ 114,457            |\n| Accumulated depreciation and amortization | (69,668)        | (72,340)             |\n| Total property, plant and equipment, net  | $ 43,398        | $ 42,117             |\n\n## Other Income/(Expense), Net\n\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\n\n|                                   | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Six Months Ended   | Six Months Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                   | April 1, 2023        | March 26, 2022       | April 1, 2023      | March 26, 2022     |\n| Interest and dividend income      | $ 918                | $ 700                | $ 1,786            | $ 1,350            |\n| Interest expense                  | (930)                | (691)                | (1,933)            | (1,385)            |\n| Other income/(expense), net       | 76                   | 151                  | (182)              | (52)               |\n| Total other income/(expense), net | $ 64                 | $ 160                | $ (329)            | $ (87)             |\n\n## Note 5 - Income Taxes\n\n## European Commission State Aid Decision\n\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'General Court'). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\n\n## Note 6 - Debt\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes ('Commercial Paper') pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had $2.0 billion and $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis  section  and  other  parts  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  ('Form  10-Q')  contain  forward-looking  statements,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements  Forward-looking . statements can also be identified by words such as 'future,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'predicts,' 'will,' 'would,' 'could,' 'can,' 'may,' and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the '2022 Form 10-K') under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the 'Company' and 'Apple' as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\n\n## Available Information\n\nThe  Company  periodically  provides  certain  information  for  investors on  its corporate  website,  www.apple.com,  and  its  investor  relations website, investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance,  information  on  environmental,  social  and  governance matters, and details related to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\n## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\n## Fiscal Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\n\n## Quarterly Highlights\n\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company's total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022.

The Company's effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the U.S. federal R&amp;D credit and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the second quarter of 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&amp;D credit. The Company's effective tax rate for the first six  months  of  2023  was  lower  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2022  due  primarily  to  the  impact  of  U.S.  foreign  tax  credit  regulations  issued  by  the  U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&amp;D credit, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe  Company's  contractual  cash  requirements  have  not  changed  materially  since  the  2022  Form  10-K,  except  for  commercial  paper  and  manufacturing purchase obligations.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes ('Commercial Paper') pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had $2.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\n\n## Manufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of April 1, 2023, the Company  had  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  of  $40.5  billion,  with  $40.1  billion  payable  within  12  months.  The  Company's  manufacturing  purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\n\n## Capital Return Program\n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program, under which the remaining availability was $22.6 billion as of April 1, 2023. On May 4, 2023, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company's common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2023. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 3.

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial  officer  have  concluded  that  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') were effective as of April 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company's  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## Item 1.    Legal Proceedings\n\n## Epic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  (the  'Northern  California  District  Court')  against  the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store \u00ae . The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic's claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company's claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Northern California District Court's ruling. The Company is considering further review of the decision.\n\n## Other Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2023 that did not individually  or  in  the  aggregate  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting  period  for  amounts  above  management's  expectations,  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Item 1A.    Risk Factors\n\nThe Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or  unknown,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  the  2022  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  'Risk  Factors.'
