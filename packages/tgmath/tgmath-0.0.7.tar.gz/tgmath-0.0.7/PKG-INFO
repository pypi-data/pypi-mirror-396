# TGMath
by hardthingphantom

This package is mostly for quality of life, reducing casts, conversions etc.

This package contains a few useful maths functions which python doesn't offer in the way I like in the regular math package.
It also contains variable-size vector and matrix classes because I wanted them.

Features:
- Trigonometric functions with either degrees or radians (can be changed)
- Floor and ceil functions which return integers by default.
- Clamp function
- Variable size vector class.
- Variable size matrix class.

More will probably come when I find more stuff I need.
Please note this is mostly for my personal projects and I've been adding things as I need them so if there is something obvious missing please let me know. I have tried to optimise things as much as I can, especially the vec and mat classes.
