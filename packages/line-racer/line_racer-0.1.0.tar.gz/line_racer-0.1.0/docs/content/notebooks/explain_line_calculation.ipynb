    "Molecular and atomic spectral lines origin in the transitions between different energy levels of atoms or molecules. The energy level can be associated with electronic states of atoms and molecules and vibrational or rotational states of molecule. When an atom or molecule transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with an energy equal to the difference between the two levels. Conversely, when it absorbs a photon with the right energy, it can transition from a lower energy level to a higher one.\n",
    "Even though these transitions occur at specific energies (or wavenumbers/wavelengths), the observed spectral lines are not infinitely sharp. Instead, they have a certain width and shape, which is described by the line profile or line shape function. There are three mechanisms that contribute to the broadening of spectral lines: natural broadening, thermal broadening, and pressure (collisional) broadening."

Natural broadening arises from the inherent uncertainty in the energy levels of atoms and molecules due to the finite lifetime of excited states, as described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From a semi-classical perspective this can be explained by a damped oscillator model, which has a spectral power density that follows a Lorentzian profile with a width determined by the lifetime of the state. \n",

There are studies like [Gharib-Nezhad et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/rasti/rzad058) which suggest that the cutoff should be set between 25 cm$^{-1}$ and 100 cm$^{-1}$ from the line center. The general impact of a cutoff is illustrated on the following figure on the right side. \n",

    "The second option is a sub-Lorentzian treatment of the wings, which reduces the absorption in the far wings compared to the Voigt profile. This is done by multiplying the Lorentzian part of the Voigt profile with a factor that decreases with distance from the line center. We implemented the [Hartmann et al. 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407301000589) sub-Lorentzian treatment, which was originally measured for CH4 lines that were collisionally broadened by H2. However, it is also used as an approximation for other molecules and broadening species in the absence of better data.

Therefore, the line profile calculation in line racer is split into two different methods depending on the size of the line list. If the line list is small, which is here defined as less than 200 lines per 1cm$^{-1}$, the [Mollière et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813...47M/abstract) method is used.

    "The first method is adapted from [Mollière et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813...47M/abstract) and uses the [Humlícek, 1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022407382900784?via%3Dihub) algorithm to calculate the line profiles. However, since the Humlícek algorithm is computationally expensive, Mollière et al. 2015 introduced a speedup for the far wings of the lines. It calculates the line cores on the full resolution of the grid and uses a coarser grid for the wings of the lines and then interpolates it back to the full grid. The whole grid is divided into sub grids. More specifically, if a subgrid $n \\neq m$ is located far away from sub grid $m$, the line profile is only calculated on the coarse grid of $m$ and then interpolated back to the full grid. This speedup is illustrated in the following figure, which is taken from Mollière et al. 2015. The black crosses indicate the calculation of the line profile on the full resolution in sub grid $m$, while the red crosses indicate the calculation on the coarse grid and then interpolated back to the full grid.

    "The sampling technique is based on [M. Min 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A...9M/abstract). It has the huge advantage, that the lines are not calculated on every grid point, but are rather sampled randomly according to the line profile and the desired precision. This means, that lines that are very weak and only contributing to the background can be sampled with a low number of samples and therefore a lower precision but high speed. On the other hand, strong lines can be sampled with a high number of samples and therefore a higher precision. This leads to a huge speedup in the line profile calculation, especially for large line lists with many weak lines.\n",

Adding two random numbers drawn from different distributions is equivalent to drawing a random number from the convolution of the two distributions, which is the Voigt profile in our case. Therefore, to obtain the Voigt profile, the sum of the samples is added to the center location of the line $\\nu_0$ and in the wavenumber bin, that contains the sampled value, a weight is added. In the simplest case, one can just add 1 and normalize the profile afterward. However, you could also directly use 1/N, with N being the number of samples, to obtain a normalized profile directly, assuming bin widths of 1. \n",

To better visualize the convolution, the dashed grey line shows that the Lorentzian sample is shifted to the drawn Gaussian sample. In the bin that contains the sampled Voigt value, a weight is added, as indicated by the black box. This would be a line sampled with one sample, assuming bin widths of 15 cm$^{-1}$.\n"
