Set of PyMoDAQ plugins for cameras by Basler, using the pypylon library. It handles basic camera functionalities (gain, exposure, ROI) and more advanced functionalities can be added by modifying a config file described below.
The data is emitted together with spatial axes corresponding either to pixels or to real-world units (um). The pixel size of different camera model is hardcoded in the hardware/basler.py file.
If the camera model is not specified, the pixel size is set to 1 um and can be changed manually by the user in the interface.

The plugin has been tested using acA640-120gm, acA1920-40gm, and puA1600-60um camera models. It is compatible with PyMoDAQ version greater than 4.4.7.

Config files are needed for different camera models. Examples for the acA1920-40gm and puA1600-60um camera models are given in the resources directory. 
The name of the config file should be config_<model_name> where <model_name> is the output of tlFactory.EnumerateDevices()[camera_index].GetModelName(). 
The module will look for this file in the ProgramData/.pymodaq folder in Windows and /etc/.pymodaq folder in Linux and if not found, a default config file can be created upon camera initialization.
The config file is a JSON which is expected to contain entries according to the ParameterTree structure of PyMoDAQ plugin parameters. The name of an entry is either a Group Parameter or the underlying camera feature, which must have the name that is used by the API, i.e. ExposureTime or GainRaw.
