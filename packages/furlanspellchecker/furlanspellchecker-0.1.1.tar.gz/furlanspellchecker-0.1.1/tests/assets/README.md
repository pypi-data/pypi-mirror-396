This directory contains reference data and test assets for validating FurlanSpellChecker functionality against the original COF (Coretôr Ortografic Furlan) implementation.

- **Source**: Original COF lemmas database (2015)
- **Content**: Friulian lemmas with optional homograph numbers

## Usage

These dictionary assets are used by the test suite to:

1. **Dictionary Validation**: Cross-check dictionary completeness and accuracy against COF reference
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Test with realistic data volumes from authoritative sources
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing dictionary functionality

**Note**: Test data files (validation wordlists, reference results) are located in `tests/results/` 
and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Data Provenance

All dictionary data originates from the original COF (Coretôr Ortografic Furlan) project, 
developed for Friulian language spell checking. The data represents the authoritative 
reference for Friulian orthography and word forms as of 2015.
