## [0.0.3-beta] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Overlap Visualization**: Shared text between adjacent chunks is now highlighted in gold/yellow
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Each chunk card has a 📋 copy button to copy chunk text
- **Strategy Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press 1-5 to quickly switch chunking strategies
  - `1` = Token-based, `2` = Sentence, `3` = Paragraph, `4` = Recursive, `5` = Fixed

### Changed
- Chunk cards now show overlap indicator (🔗) and overlap character count
- Help overlay updated with new keyboard shortcuts and feature documentation

## [0.0.2-beta] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed
- **Embedding 500 Error (Bulletproof Fix)**: Completely resolved Ollama `500 Internal Server Error` that occurred when changing chunk parameters rapidly
  - **OllamaProvider**: 5 retries with aggressive exponential backoff (1-8 seconds)
  - **OllamaProvider**: Global async lock prevents concurrent embedding batches
  - **OllamaProvider**: 200ms delay between sequential requests
  - **App**: Automatic cancellation of in-flight embeddings when parameters change
  - **App**: Silent handling of cancellation (no error messages during rapid slider changes)
  - **App**: Graceful degradation - app continues working even if embeddings fail

### Changed
- `OllamaProvider.embed()` now accepts optional `max_retries` parameter (default: 3)
- `OllamaProvider.embed_batch()` now processes embeddings sequentially with rate limiting instead of all at once

### Technical Details
- Modified: `rag_tui/core/providers.py` - Added retry logic and rate limiting to Ollama embedding methods
- Modified: `rag_tui/core/llm.py` - Added semaphore-based concurrency control (for API consistency)
