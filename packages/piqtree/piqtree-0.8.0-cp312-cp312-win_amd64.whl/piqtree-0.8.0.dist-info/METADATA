`piqtree` (pronounced 'pie-cue-tree') is a library which allows you to use IQ-TREE directly from Python! The interface with Python is through [cogent3](https://cogent3.org) objects.
For usage, please refer to the [documentation](https://piqtree.readthedocs.io/) or the examples below.

If you encounter any problems or have any feature requests feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/iqtree/piqtree/issues)!

If you would like to help out by contributing to the piqtree project, please check out our [contributor guide](https://piqtree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/)!

## Examples

### Phylogenetic Reconstruction

```python
from piqtree import build_tree
from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs # Included with piqtree!

# Load Sequences
aln = load_aligned_seqs("tests/data/example.fasta", moltype="dna")
aln = aln.take_seqs(["Human", "Chimpanzee", "Rhesus", "Mouse"])

# Reconstruct a phylogenetic tree with IQ-TREE!
tree = build_tree(aln, "JC", rand_seed=1) # Optionally specify a random seed.

print("Tree topology:", tree) # A cogent3 tree object
print("Log-likelihood:", tree.params["lnL"])
# In a Jupyter notebook, try tree.get_figure() to see a dendrogram
```

> **Note**
> See the [cogent3 docs](https://cogent3.org) for examples on what you can do with cogent3 trees.

### Fit Branch Lengths to Tree Topology

```python
from piqtree import fit_tree
from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs, make_tree

# Load Sequences
aln = load_aligned_seqs("tests/data/example.fasta", moltype="dna")
aln = aln.take_seqs(["Human", "Chimpanzee", "Rhesus", "Mouse"])

# Construct tree topology
tree = make_tree("(Human, Chimpanzee, (Rhesus, Mouse));")

# Fit branch lengths with IQ-TREE!
tree = fit_tree(aln, tree, "JC")

print("Tree with branch lengths:", tree)
print("Log-likelihood:", tree.params["lnL"])
```

## More

For more examples ranging from using ModelFinder and AliSim, to making rapid neighbour-joining trees, or randomly generated trees be sure to check out the [documentation](https://piqtree.readthedocs.io/)!
