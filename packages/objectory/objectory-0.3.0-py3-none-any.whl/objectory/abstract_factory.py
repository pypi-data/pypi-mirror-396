    Please read the documentation about this abstract factory to
    learn how it works and how to use it.

    To avoid potential conflicts with the other classes, all the
    non-public attributes or functions starts with
    ``_abstractfactory_****`` where ``****`` is the name of the
    attribute or the function.

    Args:
        name: The class name. This becomes the ``__name__`` attribute
            of the class.
        bases: A tuple of the base classes from which the class
            inherits. This becomes the ``__bases__`` attribute of the
            class.
        dct: A namespace dictionary containing definitions for the
            class body. This becomes the ``__dict__`` attribute of the
            class.

    Example usage:

    ```pycon

    >>> from objectory import AbstractFactory
    >>> class BaseClass(metaclass=AbstractFactory):
    ...     pass

        This method creates an instance of a registered class or calls

                class name. Supports name resolution for registered
                objects.

                constructor or function.
            _init_: The function or method to use to create the object.
                If ``"__init__"`` (default), the object is created by
                calling the constructor. Can also be ``"__new__"`` or
