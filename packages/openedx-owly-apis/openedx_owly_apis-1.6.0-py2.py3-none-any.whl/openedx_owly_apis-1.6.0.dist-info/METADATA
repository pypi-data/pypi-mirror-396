Extra API endpoints for Open edX
********************************

This Django app provides additional REST API endpoints for Open edX to enable advanced features such as analytics, course management, and role inspection. It is intended to be deployed inside an Open edX platform using Tutor.

Installation (via Tutor plugin)

Quick start with Tutor:

1. Install the plugin

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor plugins install git+https://github.com/aulasneo/tutor-contrib-owly.git

2. Enable and configure

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor plugins enable owly
      tutor config save

3. Apply and start

   .. code-block:: bash
