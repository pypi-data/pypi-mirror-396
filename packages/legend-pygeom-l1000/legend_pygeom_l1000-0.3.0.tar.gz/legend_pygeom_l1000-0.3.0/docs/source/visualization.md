# Visualization

The `legend-pygeom-l1000` package provides powerful visualization capabilities
through VTK (Visualization Toolkit), allowing you to inspect and explore the
geometry interactively. Refer to
[GDML-Viewer](https://legend-pygeom-tools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/vis.html#gdml-viewer)
for more details on the usage and features.

## Basic Visualization

### Opening the Viewer

The simplest way to visualize a geometry is:

```console
legend-pygeom-l1000 --visualize
```

This generates the geometry using default settings and immediately opens an
interactive 3D viewer window.
