PhaseLab: A framework for phase-coherence analysis across quantum, biological, and dynamical systems.

Built on the Informational Relativity (IR) framework, PhaseLab provides:
- Quantum coherence metrics (R̄, V_φ) for simulation reliability
- CRISPR/CRISPRa guide RNA design pipelines
- Circadian clock modeling for gene therapy dosage optimization
- Protein folding and dynamics coherence assessment (v0.2.0)
- Tissue-specific chromatin accessibility models (v0.2.0)
- Multi-tissue circadian models with inter-tissue coupling (v0.3.0)
- Drug response modeling and chronotherapy optimization (v0.3.0)
- Expanded CRISPR editors: base editing (ABE/CBE) and prime editing (v0.3.0)
- Complete CRISPR toolkit with knockout and CRISPRi (v0.4.0)
- Therapeutic dosage optimization with haploinsufficiency models (v0.4.0)

NEW in v0.5.0:
- Real ATAC-seq BigWig integration for tissue-specific accessibility
- CpG methylation modeling for CRISPRa efficiency prediction
- Nucleosome occupancy prediction (NuPoP-like algorithm)
- Multi-guide synergy modeling for combinatorial CRISPR
- Enhancer targeting for CRISPRa
- AAV serotype selection and delivery modeling
- Immunogenicity prediction for Cas9 and guide RNA
- Comprehensive validation report generation
