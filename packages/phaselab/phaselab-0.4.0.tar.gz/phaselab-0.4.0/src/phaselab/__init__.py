PhaseLab: A framework for phase-coherence analysis across quantum, biological, and dynamical systems.

Built on the Informational Relativity (IR) framework, PhaseLab provides:
- Quantum coherence metrics (R̄, V_φ) for simulation reliability
- CRISPR/CRISPRa guide RNA design pipelines
- Circadian clock modeling for gene therapy dosage optimization
- Protein folding and dynamics coherence assessment (v0.2.0)
- Tissue-specific chromatin accessibility models (v0.2.0)
- Multi-tissue circadian models with inter-tissue coupling (v0.3.0)
- Drug response modeling and chronotherapy optimization (v0.3.0)
- Expanded CRISPR editors: base editing (ABE/CBE) and prime editing (v0.3.0)
