# 🕵️‍♂️ Code Inspector AI

> **Your Multi-Agent Senior Engineer for the Terminal.**

Code Inspector is a **local-first, multi-agent CLI** that automates the entire code review workflow. Unlike simple linters, it uses a team of specialized AI agents to perform deep architectural reviews, generate commits and write PR descriptions.

## 🤖 The Multi-Agent Team

You aren't just running a script; you're hiring a digital squad:

*   **The Architect (Senior Reviewer)**: The heavy hitter. It reads full files, understands your system's design, and catches the expensive mistakes that linters miss.
*   **The Scribe (Commit Agent)**: Watches your staged changes and crafts precise, Conventional Commit messages so you never write "wip" again.
*   **The Communicator (PR Agent)**: Reads your entire branch history and writes a beautiful Pull Request description that your manager will love.


## Installation

```bash
pip install codeinspector
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Set your API Key
You need a Google Gemini API key (Free tier works great).

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

# Linux/Mac
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Configure Your Engineer (Optional)
Pick your preferred model (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro` for reasoning, `gemini-2.0-flash` for speed).

```bash
codeinspector config model
```

### 3. Review Your Code
Stage your changes and let the agents get to work.

```bash
git add .
codeinspector review --interactive
```

## 📖 The "Bad Cop" Story: Why Rules Matter

Every engineering team has "Unwritten Rules" that cause endless debates in Pull Requests (e.g., *"No DB calls in controllers"* or *"No N+1 queries"*).

**Code Inspector ends the debate.** By defining your "Team Constitution" in `codeinspector.yaml`, you turn the AI into your designated **Bad Cop**.

**How to set it up:**

1.  **Initialize the Rules**:
    ```bash
    codeinspector config rules init
    ```
    *(This creates a `codeinspector.yaml` with best-practice defaults)*

2.  **Add Your Own**:
    ```bash
    codeinspector config rules add "SECURITY: All internal APIs must check for 'X-Internal-Token'."
    ```

Now, when a developer runs `codeinspector review`, the AI will strictly enforce *your* specific architectural standards before a human ever looks at the code.
