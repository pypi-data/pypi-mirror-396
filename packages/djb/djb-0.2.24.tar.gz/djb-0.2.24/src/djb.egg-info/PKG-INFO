</a>

`djb` is a deployment platform for Django applications with frontend tooling (Bun). It provides utilities for secrets management, deployment, and development workflows.

## Installation

If you don't have uv installed yet:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Install djb as a dependency in your project:

```bash
# Add djb to your project
uv add djb

# Verify djb is available
djb --help
```

For local development of djb alongside your project:

```bash
# Clone djb into your project as a subdirectory
git clone https://github.com/kajicom/djb

# Install in editable mode
djb editable-djb
```

## Configuration

djb uses a layered configuration system with four global settings:

| Setting | CLI Flag | Env Var | Config Key | Default |
|---------|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Project Name | `--project-name` | `DJB_PROJECT_NAME` | `project_name` | `pyproject.toml` project.name |
| Mode | `--mode` | `DJB_MODE` | `mode` | `development` |
| Target | `--target` | `DJB_TARGET` | `target` | `heroku` |
| Project Dir | `--project-dir` | `DJB_PROJECT_DIR` | `project_dir` | Current directory |

**Resolution priority** (highest to lowest):
1. CLI flag
2. Environment variable
3. `.djb/config.yaml`
4. Default value

### Modes

- `development` - Local development (default)
- `staging` - Staging environment
- `production` - Production deployment

Mode affects which secrets are loaded during deployment and triggers safety guards:

```bash
# Deploy with production mode (recommended)
djb --mode production deploy heroku

# Mode persists to config when explicitly set
djb --mode production deploy heroku  # Saves mode=production
djb deploy heroku                    # Uses saved production mode
```

### Configuration File

Configuration is stored in `.djb/config.yaml`:

```yaml
project_name: myapp
mode: production
name: Your Name
email: you@example.com
```

Run `djb init` to set up configuration interactively.

## Features

### Initialization

One-command setup for development environment:

```bash
# Full initialization
djb init

# Initialize with options
djb init --skip-brew          # Skip Homebrew dependencies
djb init --skip-frontend      # Skip frontend setup
djb init --skip-secrets       # Skip secrets initialization
djb init --project-root /path # Specify project directory
```

This installs:
- System dependencies via Homebrew (age, SOPS, PostgreSQL, GDAL, Bun)
- Python dependencies (`uv sync`)
- Frontend dependencies (`bun install`)
- Encrypted secrets management

### Secrets Management

Age + SOPS encrypted secrets for secure configuration:

```bash
# Initialize secrets (creates .age/keys.txt in project root)
djb secrets init

# Edit environment secrets
djb secrets edit dev
djb secrets edit production

# View secrets
djb secrets view dev
djb secrets list

# Backup private key to clipboard (store in password manager!)
djb secrets export-key | pbcopy
```

Each project has its own encryption key stored in `.age/keys.txt`. 
Make sure to back up your key securely. If lost, you won't be able to decrypt existing secrets.
Copy your private Age key to the clipboard: 
```bash
djb secrets export-key | pbcopy
```

**Documentation**: See [docs/SECRETS_GUIDE.md](../docs/SECRETS_GUIDE.md)

### Health Checks

Run linting, type checking, and tests for your project:

```bash
# Run all health checks (lint + typecheck + tests with coverage)
djb health

# Run specific checks
djb health lint             # Run linting (black for backend, bun lint for frontend)
djb health lint --fix       # Auto-fix lint issues
djb health typecheck        # Run type checking (pyright for backend, tsc for frontend)
djb health test             # Run tests (pytest for backend, bun test for frontend)
djb health e2e              # Run E2E tests (pytest --run-e2e)

# Scope to backend or frontend only
djb health --backend        # Backend checks only
djb health --frontend       # Frontend checks only
djb health --backend typecheck  # Backend type checking only
```

**Code Coverage**: Tests run with coverage enabled by default. Coverage reports show which lines are missing test coverage:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage (default)
djb health test

# Disable coverage for faster test runs
djb health test --no-cov
```

Coverage configuration is in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.coverage.*]` sections. HTML reports are generated in `htmlcov/`.

**Editable Mode Awareness**: When djb is installed in editable mode (e.g., during development), health checks automatically run for both the djb package and the host project. When running from inside the djb directory, only djb is checked (host project is skipped).

### Deployment

Heroku deployment with frontend builds, secrets sync, and migrations:

```bash
# Deploy to Heroku (uses project_name from config)
djb deploy heroku

# Deploy in production mode (recommended)
djb --mode production deploy heroku

# Or specify app explicitly
djb deploy heroku --app myapp

# Deploy with options
djb deploy heroku --local-build --skip-secrets

# Configure Heroku app (buildpacks, postgres, git remote)
djb deploy heroku setup

# Revert to previous deployment
djb deploy heroku revert

# Revert to specific commit
djb deploy heroku revert abc1234
```

**Project Name**: The Heroku app name is determined from:
1. `--app` CLI option
2. `project_name` in `.djb/config.yaml`
3. `project.name` in `pyproject.toml`

Run `djb init` to configure your project name.

## Usage

### Command Line

Run djb commands directly:

```bash
djb <command>
```

### Python API

Import djb modules directly in Python code:

```python
from djb.secrets import load_secrets, load_secrets_for_mode
from djb.types import Mode

# Load secrets by environment name
secrets = load_secrets("production")
api_key = secrets['api_keys']['stripe']

# Load secrets by Mode enum (recommended for CLI integration)
secrets = load_secrets_for_mode(Mode.PRODUCTION)

# Get project name from config
from djb import get_project_name
project = get_project_name()  # Returns project_name from config or pyproject.toml
```

## Development

### Adding New Commands

1. Create a new subcommand module in `djb/cli/`
2. Define your Click command group
3. Register it in `djb/cli/djb.py`:

```python
from djb.cli.mycommand import mycommand

djb_cli.add_command(mycommand)
```

### Adding New Features

1. Implement the feature in an appropriate module under `djb/`
2. Export public API in `djb/__init__.py` if needed
3. Add CLI commands if applicable
4. Update documentation

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Integrated Development

djb can be embedded within projects as a subdirectory and installed in editable mode.
This allows:

1. Rapid iteration on both the platform and application
2. Project-specific customization
3. Simplified dependency management during development

For production deployments, djb is installed from PyPI.

## Future Plans

Planned djb features:

- [x] Environment initialization - `djb init`
- [x] Deployment commands (Heroku) - `djb deploy heroku`, `djb deploy heroku revert`
- [x] Heroku setup - `djb deploy heroku setup` (buildpacks, postgres, git remote)
- [x] Project name auto-detection from config and pyproject.toml
- [x] Global configuration (mode, target, project_name)
- [x] Deployment guards (warns if not in production mode)
- [x] Mode-based secrets loading
- [x] Git hooks setup via `djb init` (pre-commit hook for editable djb check)
- [x] Multi-recipient secret encryption
- [x] Secret rotation automation
- [ ] Deployment commands (Kubernetes)
- [ ] Development server management
- [ ] Database migration utilities
- [ ] Environment variable syncing
