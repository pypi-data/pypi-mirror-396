class SubprocessRecorder(SubprocessRunner):
    """
    High-performance screen and audio recorder using GStreamer subprocess.

    This recorder runs GStreamer as a subprocess to capture screen content
    and audio, providing excellent performance and stability for long recordings.
    Supports various output formats and hardware acceleration.

    Examples:
        Basic screen recording with audio:

        >>> recorder = SubprocessRecorder()
        >>> recorder.configure(
        ...     filesink_location="recording.mkv",
        ...     record_audio=True,
        ...     record_video=True,
        ...     fps=30
        ... )
        >>> recorder.start()
        >>> # ... recording runs in background ...
        >>> recorder.stop()

        Video-only recording with custom settings:

        >>> recorder.configure(
        ...     filesink_location="video_only.mp4",
        ...     record_audio=False,
        ...     record_video=True,
        ...     fps=60,
        ...     show_cursor=False
