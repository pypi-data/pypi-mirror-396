              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
                  Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Overview

Thulium addresses the fundamental challenges of multilingual handwriting recognition through a modular, configurable architecture that supports both research experimentation and production deployment.

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Multilingual Recognition** | 56 languages across Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, Georgian, Armenian, CJK, and other scripts |
| **SoTA Architectures** | CNN-RNN-CTC, Vision Transformer (ViT), Conformer, and attention-based seq2seq models |
| **Language Model Integration** | N-gram and neural language models for enhanced decoding accuracy |
| **Production-Ready** | Optimized inference, batch processing, and comprehensive error handling |
| **Research-Oriented** | Modular components, configurable pipelines, and reproducible experiments |

### Design Principles

1. **Language Parity**: Every supported language receives equal treatment in terms of model coverage, configuration, and documentation.
2. **Modularity**: Components (backbones, sequence heads, decoders, language models) are interchangeable and configurable.
3. **Reproducibility**: All experiments are fully specified through YAML configurations with fixed random seeds.
4. **Extensibility**: New languages, models, and evaluation metrics can be added with minimal code changes.

## Evaluation Metrics

Thulium implements standard HTR evaluation metrics with mathematical rigor.

### Character Error Rate (CER)

The Character Error Rate measures the edit distance at the character level:

```
CER = (S + D + I) / N
```

Where:
- **S** = Number of substitutions
- **D** = Number of deletions
- **I** = Number of insertions
- **N** = Total characters in reference

### Word Error Rate (WER)

The Word Error Rate applies the same formula at the word level:

```
WER = (S_w + D_w + I_w) / N_w
```

### Fairness Metrics

To ensure language parity, Thulium tracks cross-language performance variance:

```
Delta_CER = max(CER_l) - min(CER_l)
Sigma_CER = sqrt(sum((CER_l - mean_CER)^2) / L)
```

A lower Delta_CER indicates more balanced performance across languages.

### Usage

```python
from thulium.evaluation.metrics import cer, wer, cer_wer_batch

# Single pair
error_rate = cer("reference text", "recognized text")

# Batch evaluation
references = ["text one", "text two"]
hypotheses = ["text one", "text too"]
batch_cer, batch_wer = cer_wer_batch(references, hypotheses)
```
