# Armenian Script Model Configuration
#
# Specialized model for Armenian language using the Armenian alphabet.
# Armenian has 39 letters in the Eastern Armenian variant. This model
# is tailored specifically for Armenian handwriting recognition.
#
# Note: Armenian is a low-resource language for HTR. Transfer learning
# with fine-tuning on Armenian data is recommended.
