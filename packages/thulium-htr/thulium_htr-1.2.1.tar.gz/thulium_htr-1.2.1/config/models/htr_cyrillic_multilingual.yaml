# Multilingual Cyrillic Script Model Configuration
#
# This model handles Cyrillic-based writing systems including:
# - Russian (primary baseline)
# - Ukrainian (with specific characters i, yi, ie, g with upturn)
# - Bulgarian
# - Serbian (Cyrillic script variant)
#
# The model is optimized for the shared Cyrillic character set while
# maintaining accuracy for language-specific orthographic patterns.
