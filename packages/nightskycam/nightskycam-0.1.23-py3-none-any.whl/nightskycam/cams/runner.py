    Runner for taking pictures when "suitable" to do so.

    Configuration keys:

    - start_time (formatted: "%H:%M")
    - end_time (formatted: "%H:%M")
    - use_sun_alt (bool)
    - use_weather (bool)
    - cloud_cover_threshold (int between 0 and 100)
    - nightskycam: name of the system on which the runner is executed
    - frequency: frequency at which pictures will be taken (in Hz)
    - destination_folder : folder in which images will be saved
    - pause (bool): if true, no picture should be taken

    Pictures will not be taken when:

    - use_weather is True and the current cloud cover is above
      cloud_cover_threshold.
    - pause is true

    Pictures will be taken when:

    - use_sun_alt is true and it is currently night
    - use_sun_alt is False and the current time is between start_time
      and end_time

    The runner will read the current states "night" and "cloud_cover"
    from the shared memory. Data in the shared memory is filled by
    an instance of [nightskycam.location_info.runner.LocationInfoRunner]().
    If no instance of LocationInfoRunner is running (or if one is running
    but fails to fetch the data from internet), then the runner will behave
    the same is if use_sun_alt and use_weather are False.

    When pictures are taken, they are taken at the specified frequency.
    Between pictures, the runner will sleep in a manner such that all
    runners iterating at the same frequency will take a picture at the same
    time, assuming the systems on which they run have clock synchronization
    (e.g. via Network Time Protocol).
