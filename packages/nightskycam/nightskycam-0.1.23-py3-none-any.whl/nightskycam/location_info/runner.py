    An instance of Forecast will write a dictionary
    in the shared memory under this key
    Runner that fetch from [meteosource](https://www.meteosource.com)
    information regarding the location of the system.
    It also determines using [ephem](https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/)
    if it is currenttly night time.
    The information is written in the shared memory under the key
    [LocationInfoRunner.sm_key](). These values are written in the
    shared memory dictionary:

    - night (True means currently night time)
    - weather: current weather description (e.g. 'rainy')
    - temperature: in degree celcius
    - cloud cover: in percentage, 0% meaning no clouds at all over the area
    - time stamp: machine time the data was written in the shared memory

    The value of the data written in the shared memory is updated every:

    - at most once per [nightskycam.utils.weather.WEATHER_UPDATE_PERIOD][] 
      minutes for the weather
    - at most once per [nightskycam.utils.night.NIGHT_UPDATE_PERIOD minutes 
      for the day/night status

    The required configuration keys are:

    - place_id: the location of the system, as supported by meteosource.
      See: [meteosource](https://www.meteosource.com/documentation#find_places)
    - weather_api_key:
      see [meteosource pricing](https://www.meteosource.com/pricing)
      (a free key will be enough)

    An optional configuration key is:
    - sun_altitude_threshold: the sun altitude below which it will be
      considered to be night time (in radian).
      If not provided, a default value of -0.1 is used.

    This runner also writes the introspection key "outside_temperature",
    corresponding to outside temperature at the location of the system
    (as provided by meteosource.com).
    See [nightskycam.introspection.IntrospectionRunner](IntrospectionRunner)

    All the information is also shared with the world via the status of this
    runner. The status is also updated with the network IP information of
    the device and the local time at the place_id.
