    """
    Runner that ensures the system does not get out of space by deleting
    the oldest files of a given directory.

    At each iteration, the remaining space left on the "main" disk
    (i.e. the one on which "/" is mounted) is evaluated using the disk_usage
    function from the psutil package. If the space left is below
    a given threshold, the required number of files
    contained by the given directory are deleted, deleting older files first.

    Usually, this runner will be configured to delete files from the ftp
    folder. This is because it is preferable to looe some pictures rather
    than getting out of disk space, which can make the system unusable.

    Most likely, deleting of images will occur when the system looses internet
    connections for a few days. When this happens, the system may take pictures
    while failing to upload them, resulting in decreasing of available space.

    Configuration keys:

    - "folder": the folder from which files will be deleted

    - "threshold_MB": the threshold of available disk space below which
      data will be deleted.
