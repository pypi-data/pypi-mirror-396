"""A flexible programming model for training objectives.

!!! abstract "Programming Model"

    - An [`Objective`][.] is a callable which returns a (batched) scalar loss
      and a dictionary of metrics.
    - Objectives can be combined into a higher-order objective,
      [`MultiObjective`][.], which combines their losses and aggregates their
      metrics; specify these objectives using a [`MultiObjectiveSpec`][.].
