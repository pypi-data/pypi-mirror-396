Utilities to work with datasets of chemical reactions, reaction templates and template extraction

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Linux OS (or in principle Windows or macOS)

* You have installed [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) with python 3.8

The tool has been developed and fully tested on a Linux platform, but it is only occassionally tested on Windows and macOS.
If you find an issue on a Windows or macOS platform, we might be able to fix, but we might just disable that feature on those platforms.


## Installation

### For users

Setup your python environment and then run

    pip install reaction-utils

Consult the documentation for further information.

For some tasks such as atom-mapping with `rxnmapper` you need to setup additional environment and packages, see [here](https://molecularai.github.io/reaction_utils/uspto.html)

### For developers

First clone the repository using Git.

Then execute the following commands in the root of the repository

    conda env create -f env-dev.yml
    conda activate rxn-env
    poetry install --with dev

the `rxnutils` package is now installed in editable mode.

Lastly, make sure to install pre-commits that are run on every commit

    pre-commit install

## Usage

The package is divided into (currently) three sub-packages:

* `chem` - chemistry routines like template extraction or reaction cleaning
* `data` - routines for manipulating various reaction data sources
* `pipeline` - routines for building and executing simple pipelines for modifying and analyzing reactions
* `routes` - routines for handling synthesis routes

The full auto-generated API document is available [here](https://molecularai.github.io/reaction_utils/), and the documentation also provides a few examples on common tasks.

## Development

### Testing

Tests uses the ``pytest`` package, and is installed by `poetry`

Run the tests using:

    pytest -v

The full command with all flags for CI is available through an `invoke` command

    invoke run-tests

 ### Documentation generation

The documentation is generated by Sphinx from hand-written tutorials and docstrings

The HTML documentation can be generated by

    invoke build-docs

### Linting

Linting is done preferably with `pylint`. 

    invoke run-linting

Currently we do not use `mypy` to check type annotations, but this will be switched on in the future.
