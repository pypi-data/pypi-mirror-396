# Minchin.Django.Excel

This is a Django app designed to allow you to push the contents of Excel
workbooks to your Django database. I packaged it because while it seems like it
should be simple, it involved many more moving pieces (including management
commands, templates, template tags, admin pagination, etc.) than I initially
thought it should.


## Installation

The package is installable via `pip`:

```sh
pip install minchin.django.excel
```

This will also install all the required dependencies (of which there are
many...).

From there, you need to add it to your list of installed apps in your Django
`settings.py`:

```py
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  # first in line
  "related_admin",  # for minchin.django.excel

  # django built-ins
  # others...
  "django.contrib.humanize",
  
   # others...
   "minchin.django.excel",
   "prettyjson",  # for minchin.django.excel
]

# other settings...
```

Second, ensure that your `TEMPLATES` setting contains a DjangoTemplates backend
whose `APP_DIRS` options is set to `True`:

```py
# settings.py

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
        "APP_DIRS": True,
        # ...
    }
]

# other settings...
```

and then run the included database migrations:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

### Loading Excel Data

Includes is a Django management commands to load the Excel files:

```sh
python manage.py load_excel <excel_file.xlxs>
```

 From there, you would likely process the data further within Django.


### Django Admin Site

There are also several helpers so that you can see the loaded data on the
built-in Django admin site. However, you'll need to register them to your admin site:

```py
# admin.py

from minchin.django.excel.admin import WorkbookAdmin, SheetAdmin, RowAdmin
from minchin.django.excel.models import Workbook, Sheet, Row

admin.site.register(Workbook, WorkbookAdmin)
admin.site.register(Sheet, SheetAdmin)
admin.site.register(Row, RowAdmin)
```

limited. In particular though, there are no tests currently in place, and
additions there would be appreciated.
