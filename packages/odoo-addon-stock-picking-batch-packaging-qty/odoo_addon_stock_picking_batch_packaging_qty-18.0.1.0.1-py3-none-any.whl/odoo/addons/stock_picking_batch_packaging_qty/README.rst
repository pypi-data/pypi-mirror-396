Add packaging fields in tree views inside picking batch.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To view the new columns integrated into this module, we need to
configure batch transfers. To do this, we have to activate it as
follows:

1. Go to “Inventory.”
2. Activate “Batch, Wave & Cluster Transfers.”

And we need to activate product packaging:

1. Go to “Inventory.”
2. Activate “Product Packagings.”

Usage
=====

To see how this module works, we are going to create a new packaged
product:

1. Products > Products. You can create or edit a new one
2. In the “Inventory” section, add a line in “Packaging”

Where you will find the new columns:

1. Operations > Batch Transfers create one or use one with a packaged
   product.
2. Confirm the batch transfer.
3. In Detailed Operations, we see two new fields.
4. In Operations, in the hidden view, we have a new column to display.
