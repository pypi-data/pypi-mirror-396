Sinabs (Sinabs Is Not A Brain Simulator) is a python library for the development and implementation of Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs).
The library implements several layers that are `spiking` equivalents of CNN layers.
In addition it provides support to import CNN models implemented in torch conveniently to test their `spiking` equivalent implementation.
This project is managed by SynSense (former aiCTX AG).

The `sinabs-dynapcnn` was incorporated to this project, and it enables porting sinabs models to chips and dev-kits with DYNAP-CNN technology.


Installation
------------
For the stable release on the main branch:
```
pip install sinabs
```
or (thanks to [@Tobias-Fischer](https://github.com/Tobias-Fischer))
```
conda install -c conda-forge sinabs
```

For the latest pre-release on the develop branch that passed the tests:
```
pip install sinabs --pre
```
The package has been tested on the following configurations
