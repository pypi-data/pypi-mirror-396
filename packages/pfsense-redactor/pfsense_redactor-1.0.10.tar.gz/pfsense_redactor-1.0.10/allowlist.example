# pfSense Redactor Allow-list Example
#
# This file demonstrates the format for allow-list files.
# Copy this to .pfsense-allowlist (current directory) or ~/.pfsense-allowlist (home directory)
# to have it automatically loaded by default.
#
# Format:
# - One item per line
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Items can be IP addresses or domain names
# - Domain matching is case-insensitive
#
# Use cases:
# - Preserve well-known public services (DNS, NTP) that don't leak private info
# - Keep specific infrastructure IPs/domains visible for troubleshooting
# - Maintain references to external services your network depends on
