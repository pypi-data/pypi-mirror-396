# MassGen Fast Convergence Configuration
#
# Use Case: Quick answers with minimal coordination overhead
#
# This configuration demonstrates:
# - Lenient voting sensitivity for faster convergence
# - Limited new answers per agent (max 1)
# - Lenient novelty requirements
# - Cost-effective models (GPT-5-nano, Gemini Flash)
#
# Run with:
#   massgen \
#     --config configs/voting/fast_convergence_lenient.yaml \
#     "What are the key benefits of using async/await in Python?"

agents:
  - id: "agent_a"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "gpt-5-nano"

  - id: "agent_b"
    backend:
      type: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-2.5-flash"

orchestrator:
  # Lenient voting for faster convergence
  # Agents vote for existing answers more readily
  voting_sensitivity: "lenient"

  # Limit to 1 new answer per agent to avoid long coordination
  max_new_answers_per_agent: 1

  # No novelty checks for fastest execution
  answer_novelty_requirement: "lenient"

ui:
  display_type: "rich_terminal"
  logging_enabled: true

# What happens:
# 1. Both agents provide initial answers quickly
# 2. Agents vote for existing answers more readily (lenient threshold)
# 3. Each agent can only provide 1 new answer maximum
# 4. Coordination completes quickly with acceptable quality
