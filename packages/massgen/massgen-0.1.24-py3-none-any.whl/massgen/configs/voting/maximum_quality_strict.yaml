# MassGen Maximum Quality Configuration
#
# Use Case: Highest quality answers with rigorous evaluation
#
# This configuration demonstrates:
# - Strict voting sensitivity for maximum quality
# - Higher new answer limit (max 5) for thorough iteration
# - Strict novelty requirements to ensure real improvements
# - Cost-effective models (GPT-5-nano, Gemini Flash)
#
# Run with:
#   massgen \
#     --config configs/voting/maximum_quality_strict.yaml \
#     "Design a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform"

agents:
  - id: "agent_a"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "gpt-5-nano"

  - id: "agent_b"
    backend:
      type: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-2.5-flash"

orchestrator:
  # Strict voting for maximum quality
  # Agents apply high standards (all aspects, edge cases, reference-quality) before voting
  voting_sensitivity: "strict"

  # Allow up to 5 new answers per agent for thorough iteration
  max_new_answers_per_agent: 5

  # Strict novelty requirement - only accept substantially different solutions
  answer_novelty_requirement: "strict"

ui:
  display_type: "rich_terminal"
  logging_enabled: true

# What happens:
# 1. Agents provide initial answers
# 2. Agents apply high standards of excellence before voting (strict threshold)
# 3. Each agent can provide up to 5 new answers to refine quality
# 4. New answers must be substantially different (strict novelty)
# 5. Coordination continues until reference-quality answer is achieved
