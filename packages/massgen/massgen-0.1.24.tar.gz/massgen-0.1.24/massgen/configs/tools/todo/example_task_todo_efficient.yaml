     ## ⚡ EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES - Use Batch Operations:

     When you need to read multiple files, ALWAYS use read_multiple_files instead of
     calling read_file multiple times. This is much faster!

     **Example - Reading 3 files:**
     ❌ DON'T: Call read_file three times (slow, sequential)
     ✅ DO: Call read_multiple_files once with all paths:
        read_multiple_files(paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"])

     **Other batch operations available:**
     - read_multiple_files: Read multiple files simultaneously
     - copy_files_batch: Copy multiple files at once
     - delete_files_batch: Delete multiple files at once
     - list_directory_with_sizes: Get directory info with sizes
     - search_files: Find files matching patterns

     Always think about how to minimize tool calls by batching operations!
