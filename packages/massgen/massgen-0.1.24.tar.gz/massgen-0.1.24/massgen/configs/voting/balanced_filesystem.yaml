# MassGen Balanced Evaluation with Filesystem Access
#
# Use Case: Thorough code/file generation with balanced evaluation
#
# This configuration demonstrates:
# - Balanced voting sensitivity for thorough evaluation
# - Filesystem access for code/file generation tasks
# - Moderate new answer limit (max 2) for quality without excessive rounds
# - Balanced novelty requirements for meaningful improvements
# - Cost-effective models (GPT-5-nano, Gemini Flash)
#
# Run with:
#   massgen \
#     --config configs/voting/balanced_filesystem.yaml \
#     "Create a Python script that analyzes CSV files and generates visualizations"

agents:
  - id: "agent_a"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "gpt-5-nano"
      cwd: "workspace1"

  - id: "agent_b"
    backend:
      type: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
      cwd: "workspace2"

orchestrator:
  # Balanced voting for thorough evaluation
  # Agents apply detailed criteria (comprehensive, accurate, complete?) before voting
  voting_sensitivity: "balanced"

  # Allow up to 2 new answers per agent for quality refinement
  max_new_answers_per_agent: 2

  # Balanced novelty requirement - must provide meaningful differences
  answer_novelty_requirement: "balanced"

  # Workspace directories for filesystem operations
  snapshot_storage: "snapshots"
  agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"

ui:
  display_type: "rich_terminal"
  logging_enabled: true

# What happens:
# 1. Agents create files in their separate workspaces
# 2. Agents apply detailed criteria before voting (balanced threshold)
# 3. Each agent can provide up to 2 new answers to improve quality
# 4. New answers must be meaningfully different (balanced novelty)
# 5. Agents can review each other's files and iterate
