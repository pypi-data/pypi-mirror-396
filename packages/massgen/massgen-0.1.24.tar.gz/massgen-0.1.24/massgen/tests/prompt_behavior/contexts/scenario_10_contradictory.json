    "agent_a": "Always use `var` for variable declarations in JavaScript. It's the most flexible option and works in all contexts. `let` and `const` are newer features that add unnecessary complexity and should be avoided.",
    "agent_b": "Use `const` by default for all variables. Never use `var` as it's deprecated. `let` should only be used in rare cases where you absolutely need to reassign a variable.",
    "agent_c": "It doesn't matter which one you use - they all do the same thing. Pick whichever you prefer based on personal style preference."
