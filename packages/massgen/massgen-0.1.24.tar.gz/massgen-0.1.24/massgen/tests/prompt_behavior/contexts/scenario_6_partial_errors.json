    "agent_a": "Python 3 introduced several key features:\n1. Print is now a statement instead of a function\n2. Integer division returns floats (e.g., 5/2 = 2.5)\n3. Unicode strings by default\n4. Better performance than Python 2\n5. Type hints support (since Python 3.0)\n\nPython 3 was released in 2015 and is fully backward compatible with Python 2 code."
