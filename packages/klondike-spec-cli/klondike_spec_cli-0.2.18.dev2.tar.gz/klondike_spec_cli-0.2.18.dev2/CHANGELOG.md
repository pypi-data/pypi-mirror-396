## [0.2.16] - 2025-12-11

### ✨ Added

- **Claude Code Support** - Full support for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI as an alternative to GitHub Copilot:
  - `klondike init --agent claude` - Initialize with Claude Code templates
  - `klondike init --agent all` - Initialize with both Copilot and Claude templates
  - `klondike upgrade --agent claude` - Add Claude support to existing projects
  - Creates `CLAUDE.md` at project root with comprehensive agent instructions
  - Creates `.claude/settings.json` with permission presets
  - Creates `.claude/commands/` with custom slash commands:
    - `session-start` - Start a coding session with context gathering
    - `session-end` - End session with documentation and clean state
    - `verify-feature` - Verify feature completion with evidence
    - `progress-report` - Generate comprehensive progress report
    - `add-features` - Add features with structured criteria
    - `recover-from-failure` - Diagnose and recover from broken state
- **Agent Adapter System** - New pluggable architecture for multi-agent support:
  - Abstract `AgentAdapter` base class in `klondike_spec_cli.agents`
  - `CopilotAdapter` for GitHub Copilot (default)
  - `ClaudeAdapter` for Claude Code
  - Extensible for future agent integrations
- **Multi-Agent Projects** - Track which agents are configured per project:
  - `configured_agents` list in `config.yaml`
  - Upgrades target only configured agents by default

- **Intelligent Project Upgrade** - `klondike init` now supports existing projects with smart upgrade modes:
  - `klondike init --upgrade` (or `klondike upgrade`) - Refresh agent templates while preserving user data
  - `klondike init --force` - Complete wipe and reinit with confirmation prompt
  - Automatic version detection suggests upgrade when templates are outdated
  - Backup of agent directories before upgrade
  - Version tracking in `config.yaml` via `klondike_version` field
- **Upgrade Command** - New `klondike upgrade` command as convenient alias for `init --upgrade`

### 📝 Changed

- **Template Reorganization** - Templates moved from `github_templates` to `copilot_templates` for clarity
- **Force Mode Confirmation** - `klondike init --force` now requires typing 'yes' to confirm destructive operation
- **Smarter Init Behavior** - Detects existing projects and suggests `--upgrade` instead of erroring immediately
- **Config Model** - Added `klondike_version` and `configured_agents` fields to track project state

---

## [0.2.15] - 2025-12-10

### ✨ Added

- **Pith Framework Integration** - Migrated to Pith (pypith) for agent-native CLI with semantic search and progressive discovery
  - Enhanced feature start output with category, acceptance criteria, notes, and blocking status
  - FeatureCategory now accepts any string value for flexibility
  - Feature addition enhanced with implementation notes and guidance
  - Added continuous-implementation prompt for autonomous feature loops
  - Pre-commit verification instructions updated for Node.js test environment variable (`CI=true`)

### 📝 Changed

- **CI/CD Documentation** - Clarified that PyPI publishing is automated via CI/CD; manual `uv publish` is forbidden
- **Category Flexibility** - FeatureCategory enum removed in favor of free-form string categories
- **Test Commands** - Node.js test commands now include `CI` environment variable for non-interactive execution

---

## [0.2.14] - 2025-12-09

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Windows UTF-8 encoding** - Fixed encoding error when applying worktree diffs containing UTF-8 characters on Windows. Now explicitly uses UTF-8 encoding for `git apply` operations.
- **Auto-cleanup after --apply** - Worktrees are now automatically cleaned up (with force) after successfully applying changes to the main project. Previously, worktrees with modified/untracked files would remain and require manual cleanup.
- **Exclude .klondike/ from worktree diffs** - When the agent runs `klondike feature start/verify` commands inside a worktree, those state changes no longer conflict when applying code back to the main project. Only actual code changes are applied; the main project's `.klondike/` state remains authoritative.

### 📝 Changed

- Updated README documentation for worktree commands
- `klondike copilot cleanup` now documented with `--force` option for worktrees with uncommitted changes

---

## [0.2.13] - 2025-12-09
