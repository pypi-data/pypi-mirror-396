class GetStoryReactionsList(TLObject["raw.base.stories.StoryReactionsList"]):
    """Get the reaction and interaction list of a story posted to a channel, along with the sender of each reaction.
Can only be used by channel admins.




    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``B9B2881F``

    Parameters:
        peer (:obj:`InputPeer <pyrogram.raw.base.InputPeer>`):
            Channel

        id (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Story ID

        limit (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Maximum number of results to return, see pagination

        forwards_first (``bool``, *optional*):
            If set, returns forwards and reposts first, then reactions, then other views; otherwise returns interactions sorted just by interaction date.

        reaction (:obj:`Reaction <pyrogram.raw.base.Reaction>`, *optional*):
            Get only reactions of this type

        offset (``str``, *optional*):
            Offset for pagination (taken from the next_offset field of the returned stories.StoryReactionsList); empty in the first request.

    Returns:
        :obj:`stories.StoryReactionsList <pyrogram.raw.base.stories.StoryReactionsList>`
