    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``

    Parameters:
        hash (``int`` ``64-bit``):
            Hash used for caching, for more info click here.Note that the hash is computed using the usual algorithm, passing to the algorithm first the previously returned contacts.contacts.saved_count field, then max 100000 sorted user IDs from the contact list, including the ID of the currently logged in user if it is saved as a contact. Example: tdlib implementation.

    Returns:
