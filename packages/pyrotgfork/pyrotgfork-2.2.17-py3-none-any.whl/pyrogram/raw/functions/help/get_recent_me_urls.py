When installing official applications from "Download Telegram" buttons present in t.me pages, a referral parameter is passed to applications after installation.
If, after downloading the application, the user creates a new account (instead of logging into an existing one), the referral parameter should be imported using this method, which returns the t.me pages the user recently opened, before installing Telegram.
