class GetOutboxReadDate(TLObject["raw.base.OutboxReadDate"]):
    """Get the exact read date of one of our messages, sent to a private chat with another user.
Can be only done for private outgoing messages not older than appConfig.pm_read_date_expire_period .
If the peer's userFull.read_dates_private flag is set, we will not be able to fetch the exact read date of messages we send to them, and a USER_PRIVACY_RESTRICTED RPC error will be emitted.
The exact read date of messages might still be unavailable for other reasons, see here  for more info.
To set userFull.read_dates_private for ourselves invoke account.setGlobalPrivacySettings, setting the settings.hide_read_marks flag.




    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``8C4BFE5D``

    Parameters:
        peer (:obj:`InputPeer <pyrogram.raw.base.InputPeer>`):
            The user to whom we sent the message.

        msg_id (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            The message ID.

    Returns:
