        my (``bool``, *optional*):
            Starting from layer 159, messages.sendReaction will send reactions from the peer (user or channel) specified using messages.saveDefaultSendAs. If set, this flag indicates that this reaction was sent by us, even if the peer doesn't point to the current account.
