class MessageActionSetMessagesTTL(TLObject):

    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.MessageAction`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``3C134D7B``

    Parameters:
        period (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            New Time-To-Live of all messages sent in this chat; if 0, autodeletion was disabled.

        auto_setting_from (``int`` ``64-bit``, *optional*):
            If set, the chat TTL setting was set not due to a manual change by one of participants, but automatically because one of the participants has the default TTL settings enabled ». For example, when a user writes to us for the first time and we have set a default messages TTL of 1 week, this service message (with auto_setting_from=our_userid) will be emitted before our first message.
