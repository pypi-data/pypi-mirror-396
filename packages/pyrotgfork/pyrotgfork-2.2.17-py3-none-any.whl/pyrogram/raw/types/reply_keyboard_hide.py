    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.ReplyMarkup`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``

    Parameters:
        selective (``bool``, *optional*):
            Use this flag if you want to remove the keyboard for specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.Example: A user votes in a poll, bot returns confirmation message in reply to the vote and removes the keyboard for that user, while still showing the keyboard with poll options to users who haven't voted yet
