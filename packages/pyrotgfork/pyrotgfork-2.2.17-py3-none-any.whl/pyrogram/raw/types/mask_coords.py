class MaskCoords(TLObject):
    """Position on a photo where a mask should be placed when attaching stickers to media 
The n position indicates where the mask should be placed:




	 | 0 => Relative to the forehead 

	 | 1 => Relative to the eyes 

	 | 2 => Relative to the mouth 

	 | 3 => Relative to the chin 




    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.MaskCoords`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``AED6DBB2``

    Parameters:
        n (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Part of the face, relative to which the mask should be placed

        x (``float`` ``64-bit``):
            Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face size, from left to right. (For example, -1.0 will place the mask just to the left of the default mask position)

        y (``float`` ``64-bit``):
            Shift by Y-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face size, from left to right. (For example, -1.0 will place the mask just below the default mask position)

        zoom (``float`` ``64-bit``):
            Mask scaling coefficient. (For example, 2.0 means a doubled size)
