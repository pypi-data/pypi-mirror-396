class BusinessWeeklyOpen(TLObject):
    """A time interval, indicating the opening hours of a business.
Note that opening hours specified by the user must be appropriately validated and transformed before uploading them to the server, as specified here .



    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.BusinessWeeklyOpen`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``120B1AB9``

    Parameters:
        start_minute (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Start minute in minutes of the week, 0 to 7*24*60 inclusively.

        end_minute (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            End minute in minutes of the week, 1 to 8*24*60 inclusively (8 and not 7 because this allows to specify intervals that, for example, start on Sunday 21:00 and end on Monday 04:00 (6*24*60+21*60 to 7*24*60+4*60) without passing an invalid end_minute < start_minute).
