    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.LabeledPrice`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``CB296BF8``

    Parameters:
        label (``str``):
            Portion label

        amount (``int`` ``64-bit``):
            Price of the product in the smallest units of the currency (integer, not float/double). For example, for a price of US$ 1.45 pass amount = 145. See the exp parameter in currencies.json, it shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency (2 for the majority of currencies).
