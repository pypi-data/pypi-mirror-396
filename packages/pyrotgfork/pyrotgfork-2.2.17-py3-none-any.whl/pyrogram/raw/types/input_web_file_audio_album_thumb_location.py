    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.InputWebFileLocation`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``220``
        - ID: ``F46FE924``

    Parameters:
        small (``bool``, *optional*):
            Used to return a thumbnail with 100x100 resolution (instead of the default 600x600)

        document (:obj:`InputDocument <pyrogram.raw.base.InputDocument>`, *optional*):
            The audio file in question: must NOT be provided in secret chats, provide the title and performer fields instead.

        title (``str``, *optional*):
            Song title: should only be used in secret chats, in normal chats provide document instead, as it has more lax rate limits.

        performer (``str``, *optional*):
            Song performer: should only be used in secret chats, in normal chats provide document instead, as it has more lax rate limits.
