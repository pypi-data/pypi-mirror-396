This update can only be received through getDifference or in updates/updatesCombined constructors, so it will always come bundled with the updated chat, that should be applied as usual , without re-fetching the info manually.
However, full peer information will not come bundled in updates, so the full peer cache (chatFull) must be invalidated for chat_id when receiving this update.
