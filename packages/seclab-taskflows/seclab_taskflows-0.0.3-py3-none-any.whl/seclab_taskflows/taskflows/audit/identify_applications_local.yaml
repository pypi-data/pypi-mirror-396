        Inspect {{ GLOBALS_repo }} and determine its function. Determine whether the repo is a framework library,
        or a web application etc. For repo that may contain multiple applications, determine the purpose of each 
        application and the directories of each application. Repo can also be a library but contains actual applications, for 
        example, a web server and admin UI etc. that are not for testing or examples.

        Be granular when identifying components. Even if the repo is a library, do not store it as a single component.
        Group directories together according to functionalities as separate components. Try to identify standalone 
        web application or middleware and list each one as an individual component. Even in library repo, there are 
        often more granular components that represents different functionalities. Inspect file content if necessary 
        to get an idea of the functionality of the component.

        For web application, each component should consists of a single web service/server.
        
        Apart from source code, it is also useful to look at the README.md and documentations in 
        the repo.

        For each application identified, store a new component entry in the database. Provide some brief notes about the 
        functionality of the component with the entry.

        If the repo is a library, store the root directory as a library component in the database and provide some notes about 
        the purpose and the usage of the library.
        
        Identify example, demo or test code in the repo. Skip analyzing these code and do not create a component entry for these.

      user_prompt: |
        The component is in {{ RESULT_repo }} in the directory {{ RESULT_location }}. These are the 
        notes for this component:

        {{ RESULT_notes }}

        Analyze the entry points of this application. First check whether this component is a library or 
        an application. From previous analysis stated that:

        is_application ? {{ RESULT_is_app }}
        is_library ? {{ RESULT_is_library }}
        
        ## Application

        For application components, you should consider the following:

        Does this application consumes untrusted input, for example, web request? Or does it interact with 
        other applications and can take input from them? User supplied arguments, 
        configuration files, web request from hardcoded url or environment variables are not considered untrusted 
        input. 
        
        However, if user arguments are pointing to some untrusted resources, then they can be considered as 
        untrusted input. For example, a parser may take a user argument that points to a file, and in this case,
        the file is still considered untrusted even though it is supplied via user argument.

        ## Library

        For library code, identify the functions that are exposed to a library user. Consider the library user 
        as trusted and instead focus on functionalities that consumes untrusted input when they are used for 
        building applications. 
        
        Ignore applications within the library such as default UI, etc. as these are going 
        to be analyzed separately. Focus on the library code.

        For example, a web application framework may expose functionalities such as http request handlers and middleware, which 
        are typically used for handling http requests when used for building web applications. In this case, the 
        http requests handled by these handlers and middleware are considered untrusted.

        Only identify the untrusted inputs and entry points, do not analyze the security risks of the component or the 
        entry point.

        Once you're finished with this, store an "entry_point" for each entry point identified, providing the precise
        file and line number of this entry point, as well as the user inputs that it exposes. Use the "notes" field to 
        explain how the entry point is exposed to the end user and why the identified user inputs are untrusted. 
        Note that line number has to be integer. If an entry point spans multiple lines, then use the first line as the line 
        number.

        ## IMPORTANT: General Guidance that ALWAYS applies

        1. Do NOT ask the user for permission to perform next steps, continue your
        analysis autonomously until it is complete.
        
        2. Reflect on your analysis for accuracy before returning it to the user.
        We are only interested in results that you can clearly explain and
        motivate as potentially vulnerable based on code examples.

        3. Do NOT speculate. All answers should be motivated by code examples and
        match the conditions of our described vulnerability pattern. Call out
        any situation where you are unsure about your results.

      description: Identify actions that untrusted users are allowed performed the component.
      agents:
        - seclab_taskflows.personalities.web_application_security_expert
      user_prompt: |
        The component is in {{ RESULT_repo }} in the directory {{ RESULT_location }}. These are the 
        notes for this component:

        {{ RESULT_notes }}

        Analyze the actions that an untrusted user is allowed to perform. The purpose of this task is not 
        about the security of the source code, but rather get an understanding of the purpose of the component and 
        what an untrusted user should be allowed to do under the intention of the component.
        For example, the component may have an api that allows an untrusted user to run aribitrary command. In this 
        case, the intention and purpose of the component is for user to run arbitrary command, and so the user action in 
        this case is arbitrary code execution. 

        Similarly, an api may allow a user to read and write files to a specific directory. In this case the intention and 
        the user action is to read and write to restricted directory. This is different to allowing a user read and write 
        to any directories. Be precise in these details when looking at user action.

        Do not consider security risk or potential bypasses or any potential privilege escalations that is outside of the 
        intended use. Focus only on the intended use here.
        
        First check whether this component is a library or 
        an application. From previous analysis stated that:

        is_application ? {{ RESULT_is_app }}
        is_library ? {{ RESULT_is_library }}

        ## Application
        
        For application components, you should consider the following:

        What actions can a user perform using the application? Can they exectue arbitrary code? Can they 
        make arbitrary web request? Can they read any local file? Consider restrictions that are placed on the actions 
        that a user can perform using the application, and what actions the user should not be allowed to do
        when using the application.

        You should also state clearly the actions and privileges that a user can have when using the application.

        ## Library

        For library component, do the following instead:
        When considering user privileges, consider the library user as trusted and focus on the 
        functionalities that are exposed to untrusted users when the library is used. For example, a web 
        application library may provide functionalities for the library user to run arbitrary script to configure 
        the application. These are not considered "allowed actions" from an untrusted user point of view.

        However, if a library exposes a REST api that allows arbitrary files to be read by unauthenticated users, 
        then it reading arbitrary files is consider an "allowed" activity. Note any "allow" activity and how 
        they are exposed to untrusted users, referencing the file and function in detail.

        Ignore applications within the library such as default UI, etc. as these are going 
        to be analyzed separately. Focus on the library code.

        Store an user_action entry stating precising the file and line number where the allowed action is performed, and
        provide notes about the action.

        Note that line number has to be integer. If an user action spans multiple lines, then use the first line as the line 
        number.
