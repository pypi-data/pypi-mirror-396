class Dispatcher(BackgroundService):
    """A highlevel interface for the dispatch API.

    This class provides a highlevel interface to the dispatch API.
    It provides receivers for various events and management of actors based on
    dispatches.

    The receivers shortly explained:

    * [Lifecycle events receiver][frequenz.dispatch.Dispatcher.new_lifecycle_events_receiver]:
        Receives an event whenever a dispatch is created, updated or deleted.
    * [Running status change
        receiver][frequenz.dispatch.Dispatcher.new_running_state_event_receiver]:
        Receives an event whenever the running status of a dispatch changes.
        The running status of a dispatch can change due to a variety of reasons,
        such as but not limited to the dispatch being started, stopped, modified
        or deleted or reaching its scheduled start or end time.

        Any change that could potentially require the consumer to start, stop or
        reconfigure itself will cause a message to be sent.

    Example: Managing an actor
        ```python
        import os
        from frequenz.dispatch import Dispatcher, MergeByType
        from unittest.mock import MagicMock

        async def create_actor(dispatch: DispatchInfo, receiver: Receiver[DispatchInfo]) -> Actor:
            return MagicMock(dispatch=dispatch, receiver=receiver)

        async def run():
            url = os.getenv("DISPATCH_API_URL", "grpc://dispatch.url.goes.here.example.com")
            key  = os.getenv("DISPATCH_API_KEY", "some-key")

            microgrid_id = 1

            async with Dispatcher(
                microgrid_id=microgrid_id,
                server_url=url,
                auth_key=key
            ) as dispatcher:
                dispatcher.start_managing(
                    dispatch_type="DISPATCH_TYPE",
                    actor_factory=create_actor,
                    merge_strategy=MergeByType(),
                )

                await dispatcher
        ```

    Example: Processing running state change dispatches
        ```python

                async for dispatch in rs_receiver:
                    if dispatch.started:
                        print(f"Executing dispatch {dispatch.id}, due on {dispatch.start_time}")
                        if actor.is_running:
                            actor.reconfigure(
                                components=dispatch.target,

                                dry_run=dispatch.dry_run,
                                until=dispatch.until,
                            )  # this will reconfigure the actor
                        else:

                            actor.start(
                                components=dispatch.target,
                                run_parameters=dispatch.payload, # custom actor parameters
                                dry_run=dispatch.dry_run,
                                until=dispatch.until,
                            )

                        actor.stop()  # this will stop the actor
        ```

    Example: Getting notification about dispatch lifecycle events
        ```python
        import os
        from typing import assert_never

        from frequenz.dispatch import Created, Deleted, Dispatcher, Updated

        async def run():

                microgrid_id=microgrid_id,
                server_url=url,
                auth_key=key,
            ) as dispatcher:
                events_receiver = dispatcher.new_lifecycle_events_receiver("DISPATCH_TYPE")

                async for event in events_receiver:
                    match event:
                        case Created(dispatch):
                            print(f"A dispatch was created: {dispatch}")

                            assert_never(unhandled)
        ```

    Example: Creating a new dispatch and then modifying it.
        Note that this uses the lower-level `DispatchApiClient` class to create
        and update the dispatch.
