Function Descriptions
summa_3(a, b, c)

Returns the sum of three numerical values.
Useful for simple arithmetic operations that involve exactly three operands.

summa_4(a, b, c, d)

Returns the sum of four numerical values.
Provides a straightforward utility for adding four operands.

square(a, b, c)

Calculates the sum of squares of three numbers.
This is commonly used in mathematical operations such as vector magnitude or statistical computations.

circle_diameter(radius)

Computes the diameter of a circle from its radius.
Diameter is calculated using the formula:
diameter = 2 × radius.

circle_area(radius)

Returns the area of a circle based on its radius.
Uses the mathematical formula:
area = π × radius².

speed_finder(time, distance)

Calculates speed given time and distance.
Uses the basic motion formula:
speed = distance / time.

time_finder(speed, distance)

Computes the required time to travel a certain distance at a given speed.
Formula:
time = distance / speed.

distance_finder(speed, distance)

Computes the distance traveled based on speed and time.
Formula:
distance = speed × time.
(Note: Your current implementation returns distance/speed, which appears to be an error. The correct formula should be speed * time.)
