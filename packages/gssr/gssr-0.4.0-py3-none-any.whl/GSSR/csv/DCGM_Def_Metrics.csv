Metrics (units),Definition
GPU Utilization (%),Percent of time over the process’s lifetime during which one or more kernels was executing on the GPU.
SM Active (%),The ratio of cycles an SM has at least 1 warp assigned (computed from the number of cycles and elapsed cycles)
SM Occupancy (%),Occupancy is defined as the ratio of active warps on an SM to the maximum number of active warps supported by the SM
Tensor Active (%),The ratio of cycles the any tensor pipe is active (off the peak sustained elapsed cycles)
"FP Active (%)  for FP64, FP32, FP16","Ratio of cycles the a particular fp (fp64, fp32 or fp16) pipe is active."
FB Total/Used/Free/Reserved (MB),Total/Used/Free/Reserved Frame Buffer of the GPU in MB
NVLink tx/rx bytes (byte/s),"The rate of data transmitted / received over NVLink, not including protocol headers. (NVLink bandwidth)"
PCIe tx/rx bytes (byte/s),"The rate of data transmitted / received over the PCIe bus, including both protocol headers and data payloads. (PCIe bandwidth)"
