RULES:
- Use ONLY these keys: {json_keys_str}
- Each value is an array of strings (the changelog items)
- OMIT keys with no items (empty arrays)
- Each item should be a concise description of the change
- Do NOT include bullet points or markdown in the items

CLASSIFICATION:

ANTI-DUPLICATION:
- Each change goes in EXACTLY ONE section
- Never mention the same feature in multiple sections
- If a feature fits multiple categories, pick the most important one

RESPOND WITH ONLY THE JSON OBJECT. No explanations, no markdown formatting outside the JSON."""
