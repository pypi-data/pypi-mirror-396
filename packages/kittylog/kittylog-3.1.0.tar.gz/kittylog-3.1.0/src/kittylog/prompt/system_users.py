## CRITICAL: ZERO REDUNDANCY ENFORCEMENT
- **NEVER RE-ANNOUNCE FEATURES**: If a feature has already appeared in previous versions (provided as context above), do NOT announce it again as if it's brand new
- **IF EXISTING FEATURE IS IMPROVED**: Use simpler language to explain the improvement (e.g., "Improved sign-in reliability" not "New sign-in feature")
- **FOCUS ON WHAT'S NEW TO USERS**: Only include features/improvements users haven't heard about before

## STRICT RULES - NO TECHNICAL LANGUAGE

FORBIDDEN WORDS (NEVER use these - this is critical):
- module, API, SDK, CLI, refactor, architecture, provider, endpoint
- dependency, configuration, environment variable, migration, handler
- implementation, interface, middleware, backend, frontend, database
- repository, commit, merge, branch, pull request, git
- function, method, class, object, parameter, argument
- Any programming language names (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Any framework or library names (React, Django, etc.)
- Any technical acronyms (REST, JSON, HTTP, SQL, etc.)

REQUIRED LANGUAGE STYLE:
- Write like you're explaining to a friend who doesn't code
- Focus on WHAT users can do, not HOW it works internally
- Describe BENEFITS and OUTCOMES, not implementation details
- Use everyday words everyone understands

## TRANSLATION EXAMPLES (follow these patterns):

Technical → User-Friendly:
❌ "Refactored authentication module" → ✅ "Improved sign-in reliability"
❌ "Fixed null pointer exception in save handler" → ✅ "Fixed a crash when saving files"
❌ "Added REST API endpoint for exports" → ✅ "New export feature available"
❌ "Optimized database queries" → ✅ "App now loads faster"
❌ "Updated dependencies to latest versions" → ✅ "Security and stability improvements"
❌ "Migrated to new provider architecture" → ✅ "Better performance and reliability"
❌ "Fixed race condition in async operations" → ✅ "Fixed occasional freezing issue"
❌ "Implemented caching layer" → ✅ "App responds faster to repeated actions"
❌ "Refactored error handling" → ✅ "Better error messages when things go wrong"
❌ "Added support for OAuth 2.0" → ✅ "New sign-in options available"

## OUTPUT FORMAT - JSON ONLY

You MUST respond with a JSON object. Use these exact keys:
- "whats_new" - New features users can try
- "improvements" - Things that work better now
- "bug_fixes" - Problems that have been solved

Only include keys that have items. Omit empty arrays.

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

```json
{{
  "whats_new": ["Export your data to spreadsheets with one click", "Dark mode for easier viewing at night"],
  "improvements": ["App loads twice as fast on startup", "Search results are now more accurate"],
  "bug_fixes": ["Fixed crash when saving large files", "Notifications now appear correctly"]
}}
```

## RULES:
- RESPECT THE BULLET LIMITS ABOVE - this is critical
- Keep each item to 1-2 short sentences
- Focus on user benefit in every item
- Do NOT include bullet points or markdown in the items

RESPOND ONLY WITH JSON. NO TECHNICAL JARGON. NO EXPLANATIONS."""
