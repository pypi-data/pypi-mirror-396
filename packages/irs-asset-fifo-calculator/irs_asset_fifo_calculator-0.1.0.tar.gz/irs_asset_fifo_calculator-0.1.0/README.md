# IRS asset FIFO calculator

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/irs-asset-fifo-calculator/badge/?version=latest)](https://irs-asset-fifo-calculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Tax calculator that tracks capital gains from multiple purchases and sales.  This program uses a CSV file as input.  

This file is called "asset_tx.csv" in the published example, but any name can be
be used, using this name in the python call.  The file has the following header:
"Date", "Asset", "Amount (asset)", "Sell price (\$)", "Buy price (\$)", "Account number", "Entity", "Notes", "Remaining"

## What this project does

This repository implements a small Python tool to calculate IRS-style
capital gains using the FIFO (First In, First Out) method and produce
Form 8949–style output.

Given a CSV of asset transactions (buys, sells, exchanges, transfers),
the library:

1. Groups related rows by `Tx Index` into logical “blocks” (one trade).
2. Parses each block into:
   - **Buy side** (what you acquired)
   - **Sell side** (what you disposed of)
   - **Fees** (possibly in one or more assets)
3. Maintains a **FIFO ledger** of “lots” for each asset (amount, price,
   cost basis, date).
4. For each sale, consumes the oldest lots first to compute:
   - Cost basis
   - Proceeds
   - Gain or loss
5. Writes the result as rows suitable for **Form 8949**.

## FIFO in one paragraph

Under FIFO, the **earliest purchased units are considered sold first**.
If you bought 10 NVDA on January 1 and 5 NVDA on February 1, then sell
12 NVDA on March 1, the sale is treated as:

- 10 units from the January lot, and  
- 2 units from the February lot.

Each slice gets a proportional share of the total proceeds, and its own
cost basis and gain/loss. This tool automates that book-keeping and
emits one Form 8949 row per “slice”.

For a more detailed explanation (with tables and numeric examples),
see [`docs/fifo_overview.md`](docs/fifo_overview.md).

## Installation
No installation is required.  

## Quick start

1. Put your transactions in `asset_tx.csv` with the header:
   `Date, Tx Index, Asset, Amount (asset), Sell price ($), Buy price ($), Type, ...`
2. Run from CLI:
```bash
   cd src
   python -m irs_asset_fifo_calculator.calculate_taxes
```

## Technologies

IRS asset FIFO calculator uses the following technologies and tools:

- [![Sphinx](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sphinx-3B4D92?style=for-the-badge&logo=sphinx&logoColor=white)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)

## Development
### Building the docs

In order to create Sphinx documentation from the docstrings in PyCharm, a new run task must be created: 
Run > Edit Configurations... > + (top-left) > Sphinx task.  In the window that opens, name the Sphinx task in the
"Name" field, select "html" under the "Command:" dropdown, select the docs folder in the root folder in the "Input:"
field, and select the docs/_build folder in the "Output:" field.  If the docs or docs/_build folder do not already
exist, they will perhaps need to be created.  The Sphinx documentation can now be created by going to Run > Run... and
selecting the Sphinx task name.
