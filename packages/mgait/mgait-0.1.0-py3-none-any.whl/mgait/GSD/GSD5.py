class KerenGSD(BaseGsdDetector):
    """
    Implementation of the Gait Sequence Detection (GSD) algorithm for wrist-worn accelerometer data, 
    based on Keren et al. (2021) [1]_. The algorithm detects walking bouts from 3-axis acceleration 
    by applying a sequence of preprocessing, spectral, and regularity checks.

    Two optimised variants are provided:
    - **"original_wrist" (fixed thresholds)**: uses fixed the threshold form the original publication.
    - **"improved_wrist" (fixed thresholds)**: uses fixed fine-tuned threshold in people with multimorbidity.
    - **"wrist_adaptive" (adaptive thresholds)**: thresholds are set adaptively based on the percentile of 
      the detrended acceleration distribution.  

    The granularity of the implementation is 1 second.

    Steps of the algorithm:
    1. **Data Preprocessing**: compute Euclidean norm, apply low-pass filtering, detrend.  
    2. **Peak Detection**: detect peaks above threshold.  
    3. **Windowing**: segment into 6 s windows with 5 s overlap.  
    4. **Standard Deviation**: check variability in each window.  
    5. **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**: verify dominant frequency lies in walking range (0.5–3 Hz).  
    6. **Autocorrelation**: assess step/stride regularity (>0.15).  
    7. **Combining Conditions**: retain windows meeting all conditions, merge into walking bouts.  

    Notes
    -----
    - The algorithm discards the first and last 3 seconds of data due to windowing.
    - Designed for 100–128 Hz sampling rates. Resampling is required if a different rate is used.  
    - The adaptive version may improve generalisation across heterogeneous datasets.
    - The pipeline should be used with the cwb option True (default).
