class HickeyGSD(BaseGsdDetector):
    """
    Implementation of the Gait Sequence Detection (GSD) algorithm by Hickey et al. (2017), adapted for wrist- and lowback-worn devices.

    The algorithm detects periods of walking by analyzing the acceleration signals.
    It assumes higher variability (SD) in the acceleration during movement compared to still periods.
    In the lowback versions the summary of the standard deviations of all axes are used for the variability detection and the vertical axis is used for the upright detection.
    The wrist versions use the norm of the acceleration with a similar rationale than the lower back.
    However, the upright threshold is used as maximum activity threshold for a wrist device rather than an upright threshold.
    This threshold is derived from identifying the 95th percentile of the signal from walking bouts in a sample of 108 participants with diverse conditions.

    This version contains a deviation from the original algorithm:
    - Walking bouts (WB) that are closer than 3 seconds can be merged according to the consensus for continuous walking bouts (CWB).
    - Users can optionally disable CWB (cwb=False) to retain micro-walking bouts (MWB), which represent very short, discrete walking events.
    - The pipeline is intended to be used with `cwb=True` to align with the consensus-based continuous walking detection, but micro-walking detection is available for research purposes.

    Other features:
    - Wrist and lowback versions differ in preprocessing and thresholds.
    - Acceleration signals are filtered, windowed (0.1 s), and analyzed for standard deviation and mean.
    - Detected bouts shorter than 0.5 s (minimum 2 strides) are discarded.

    Other features:
    - Wrist and lowback versions differ in preprocessing and thresholds.
    - Acceleration signals are filtered, windowed (0.1 s), and analyzed for standard deviation and mean.
    - Detected bouts shorter than 0.5 s (minimum 2 strides) are discarded when cwb is set to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version : Literal["original_lowback", "improved_lowback", "wrist"], default="wrist"
        Device placement and algorithm version. Only 'wrist' is fully supported in this release.
    cwb : bool, default=True
        If True, merges micro-walking bouts into continuous walking bouts according to the 3 s rule.
        If False, micro-walking bouts are retained without merging.

    Notes:
    Wrist versions:
    - Acceleration is preprocessed by removing gravity and calculating the norm of all three axes.
    - Thresholds for stillness and activity are based on empirical data from a diverse sample.
    - The algorithm operates on resampled data (default 100 Hz), hence it can be considered sample rate agnostic.
    - Continuous walking bouts can optionally be merged if separated by short breaks (≤3s).
    Lowback version:
    - Since we process the vertical axis to point downwards the, he threshold for identifying an upright position is sett to -0.77 instead of 0.77, as stated in the original publication
    - The standing threshold uses the mean of the original vertical axis without centering it, using the centered vertical axis always leads to the standingconddition being met.
    - The algorithm operates on resampled data (default 100 Hz), hence it can be considered sample rate agnostic.

        """
        Detect walking bouts from accelerometer data (wrist or lower-back).

        This method performs both preprocessing and detection of gait sequences in a single workflow.
        The procedure differs slightly depending on the device placement (`wrist` vs `lowback`).

        Preprocessing:

        - Wrist:
            1. Remove gravity from all three axes.
            2. Compute the norm of the acceleration vector.
            3. Optionally resample to the target sampling rate (default 100 Hz).

        - Lowback (original or improved):
            1. Invert vertical (IS) and mediolateral (ML) axes to standard orientation.
            2. Optionally resample to the target sampling rate (default 100 Hz).

        Detection:

        1. Center the acceleration signal:
            - Wrist: centered norm of acceleration.
            - Lowback: each axis centered individually.
        2. Apply a low-pass Butterworth filter (17 Hz cutoff) to remove high-frequency noise.
        3. Divide the signal into 0.1s windows and compute:
            - Standard deviation (SD) of each window.
                - Wrist: SD of norm.
                - Lowback: sum of SDs across axes.
            - Mean of vertical axis (lowback) or norm (wrist).
        4. Identify windows of movement based on threshold criteria:
            - Stillness threshold (`ThresholdStill`) applied to SD.
            - Upright/activity threshold (`ThresholdUpright`) applied to mean.
        5. Merge consecutive bouts separated by ≤2.25s (window units).
        6. Remove bouts shorter than 0.5s (require at least 2 strides).
        7. Optionally merge micro-walking bouts into continuous walking bouts (CWB) if `self.cwb=True`.

        Outputs:

        - `gs_list_` : pandas DataFrame
            Contains start and end indices of detected gait sequences.
            Index labeled as `gs_id`. Start and end are clipped to the length of the input signal.

        Notes:

        - Thresholds for wrist devices were derived empirically from a diverse sample of participants.
        - Lowback versions follow orientation conventions and specific thresholds per Hickey et al., 2017.
        - Sampling rate is assumed to be 100 Hz by default; resampling is optional and applied only if the data rate differs.
