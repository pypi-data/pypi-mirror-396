class ZijlstraIC(BaseIcDetector):
    """
    Implementation of the Zijlstra initial contact (IC) detection algorithm [1],
    original and fine-tuned version for lowback devices, and adapted/fine-tuned for wrist-worn accelerometer data.
    This is a signal feature detection approach based on filtered acceleration waveforms.

        This method processes the acceleration signal by:
    1. Computing the vector norm of the tri-axial accelerometer (wrist), or selecting the anteroposterior axis (lowback).
    2. Detrending the signal to center it around zero.
    3. Applying a two-stage low-pass Butterworth filter (20 Hz then cutoff at 2.5 Hz).
    4. Identifying initial contacts using either:
       - Peak detection between zero crossings ("peak" mode, original lowback and wrist versions), or
       - Positive-to-negative zero crossings ("zc" mode).

    Attributes
    ----------
    ic_list_ : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing the detected initial contact (IC) indices.
    final_signal_ : np.ndarray
        The processed signal after detrending and low-pass Butterworth filtering.

    Notes
    -----
    - The Butterworth cutoff frequency is set to 2.5 Hz by default in theo original versions, fine-tuned versions for lowback and wrist devices
     have a different threshold adapted for typical walking cadence in multimorbid cohorts. Adjust as needed for populations with different gait speeds.
    - Designed for accelerometer data sampled at ~100 Hz.
    - We inherit from BaseIcDetector to guarantee a consistent detect() contract, gain a built-in clone() helper for safe reuse,
    and integrate with tpcp-based pipelines and utilities.
