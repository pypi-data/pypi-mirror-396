class MacLeanGSD(BaseGsdDetector):
    """
    Implementation of the Gait Sequence Detection (GSD) algorithm by MacLean et al. (2023) [1]_.
    This implementation if for lowback sensors including the original and fine-tunned versions as well as adapted and fine-tuned for wrist-worn accelerometer data.
    It identifies walking bouts by applying filtering, thresholding, and bout-merging
    steps to 3-axis accelerometer signals.

    The wrist implementation follows the structure of the original algorithm 
    but uses fixed thresholds tuned for wrist signals. The main steps are:

    1. Preprocessing: A 4th-order zero-lag low-pass Butterworth filter 
       (cutoff 0.25 Hz) is applied to remove high-frequency noise. 
       The filtered signal is subtracted from the raw data to preserve 
       movement-related frequencies.

    2. Magnitude calculation: The vector norm (3D Euclidean norm) of the 
       acceleration is computed to produce a single magnitude signal.

    3. Activity detection: A binary threshold is applied
       to the magnitude signal. Points above threshold are marked active (1), 
       below threshold inactive (0). This binary activity signal is smoothed 
       with a Gaussian-weighted moving average.

    4. Bout segmentation: Start and end points of candidate walking bouts 
       are identified. Gaps shorter than the threshold are merged with neighboring bouts.

    5. Walking classification: Each bout is validated by comparing the 
       smoothed magnitude against a walking threshold.
       If fewer than 5% of points exceed this threshold, the bout is 
       classified as walking.

    6. Post-processing: Bouts shorter than 2 seconds are discarded.
    Short breaks (< 3 s) between bouts can be merged to form continuous walking bouts (CWB).

    Attributes
    ----------
    gs_list_ : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing the start and end times of detected gait 
        sequences. Each sequence is labeled with a unique `gs_id` index.

    Notes
    -----
    - Filters and thresholds are designed for 100 Hz data. Resampling is
      required for other sampling rates.
    - Orientation correction steps from the original MATLAB implementation 
      are omitted.
    - The order of the steps are similar but the implementation is slightly difference, simplified, and computationally more efficient.
    Lowback:
    - The "original_lowback" uses the original fixed thresholds, the "improved_lowback" is a novel version with fine-tuned fixed thresholds,
      the "original_personalised_lowback" adjusts the threshold_binary as the median of the mangitude of the acceleraion, as well as the gap_index,
      the "adaptive_lowback" is a novel version ajusting the threshold_binary, gap_threshold, and walk_threshold as a percentile of the magnitude of the acceleration.
    Wrist:
    -The wrist version is a novel version adapted and fine-tuned for use with wrist-worn devices.
