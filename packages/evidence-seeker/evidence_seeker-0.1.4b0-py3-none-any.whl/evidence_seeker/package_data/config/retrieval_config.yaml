# The type of embedding backend to use.
# Options are: 'huggingface', 'tei' and 'huggingface_inference_api'.
# `huggingface`: will use Hugging Face to download the model and 
#   load it locally
# `tei` (text embedding inference): 
#   API for serving embedding models, that can be used, for instance,
#   with dedicated endpoints for embedding models by Hugging Face.
# `huggingface_inference_api`: mbedding models accessed via Hugging 
#   Face Inference Provider.
embed_backend_type: huggingface
# The name of the embedding model to use. 
# E.g., "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2", which 
# is used by default. For more information, see:
# https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2

# token name for API model access
api_key_name: API_TOKEN_EMBEDDING_MODEL
# token name for accessing index from Hugging Face Hub

# Optional: Path to a file containing API keys for the embedding model. 
# Should have the format:
# your_api_key_name=your_api_token
