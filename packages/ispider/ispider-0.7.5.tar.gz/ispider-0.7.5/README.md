# ispider_core

**ispider** is a module to spider websites

- Multicore and multithreaded  
- Accepts hundreds/thousands of websites/domains as input  
- Sparse requests to avoid repeated calls against the same domain
- The `httpx` engine works in asyncio blocks defined by `settings.ASYNC_BLOCK_SIZE`, so total concurrent threads are `ASYNC_BLOCK_SIZE * POOLS`
- It supports retry with different engines (httpx, curl, seleniumbase [testing])

It was designed for maximum speed, so it has some limitations:  
- As of v0.7, it does not support files (pdf, video, images, etc); it only processes HTML


# HOW IT WORKS - SIMPLE
**-- Crawl - Depth == 0**  
- Get all the landing pages for domains in the provided list.  
- If "robots" is selected, download the `robots.txt` file.  
- If "sitemaps" is selected, parse the `robots.txt` and retrieve all the sitemaps.  
- All data is saved under `USER_DATA/data/dumps/dom_tld`.

**-- Spider - Depth > 0**  
- Extract all links from landing pages and sitemaps.  
- Download the HTML pages, extract internal links, and follow them recursively.

# HOW IT WORKS - MORE DETAILED

#### Crawl - Depth == 0
- Create objects in the form (`('https://domain.com', 'landing_page', 'domain.com', depth, retries, engine)`)  
- Add them to the LIFO queue `qout`  
- A thread retrieves elements from `qout` in variable-size blocks (depending on `QUEUE_MAX_SIZE`)  
- Fill a FIFO queue `qin`  
- Different workers (defined in `settings.POOLS`) get elements from `qin` and download them to `USER_DATA/data/dumps/dom_tld`  
- Landing pages are saved as `_.html`  
- Each worker processes the landing page; if the result is OK (`status_code == 200`), it tries to get `robots.txt`  
- On failure, it tries the next available engine (fallback)  
- It creates an object (`('https://domain.com/robots.txt', 'robots', 'domain.com', depth=1, retries=0, engine)`)  
- Each worker retrieves the `robots.txt`; if `"sitemaps"` is defined in `settings.CRAWL_METHODS`, it attempts to get all sitemaps from `robots.txt` and `dom_tld/sitemaps.xml`  
- It creates objects (`('https://domain.com/sitemap.xml', 'sitemaps', 'domain.com', depth=1, retries=0, engine)`) and for other sitemaps found in `robots.txt`  
- Every successful or failed download is logged as a row in `USER_FOLDER/jsons/crawl_conn_meta*json` with all information available from the engine; these files are useful for statistics/reports from the spider  
- When there are no more elements in `qin`, after a 90-second timeout, jobs stop.

#### Spider - Depths > 0
- It reads entries from `USER_FOLDER/jsons/crawl_conn_meta*json` for the domains in the list  
- It retrieves landing pages and sitemaps  
- If sitemaps are compressed, it uncompresses them  
- Extract all links from landing pages and sitemaps  
- Create objects (`('https://domain.com/link1', 'internals', 'domain.com', depth=2, retries=0, engine)`)  
- Use the same engine that was used for the last successful request to the domain TLD  
- Add these objects to `qout`  
- Thread `qin` moves blocks from `qout` to `qin`, sparsing them  
- Download all links, save them, and save data in JSON  
- Parse the HTML, extract all INTERNAL links, follow them recursively, increasing depth

# USAGE

Install it
```
pip install ispider
```

First use
```
from ispider_core import ISpider

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Check the readme for the complete avail parameters
    config_overrides = {
        'USER_FOLDER': '/Your/Dump/Folder',
        'POOLS': 64,
        'ASYNC_BLOCK_SIZE': 32,
        'MAXIMUM_RETRIES': 2,
        'CRAWL_METHODS': [],
        'CODES_TO_RETRY': [430, 503, 500, 429],
        'CURL_INSECURE': True,
        'ENGINES': ['curl']
    }

    # Specify a list of domains
    doms = ['domain1.com', 'domain2.com'....]

    # Run
    with ISpider(domains=doms, **config_overrides) as spider:
        spider.run()
```

# TO KNOW
At first execution, 
- It creates the folder settings.USER_FOLDER
- It downloads the file in settings.USER_FOLDER/sources/

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danruggi/ispider/dev/static/exclude_domains.csv

that's a list of almost-infinite domains that would retain the script forever
(or other domains too that were not needed in my project)
You can update the file in ~/.ispider/sources

- It creates settings.USER_FOLDER/data/ with dumps/ and jsons/
- settings.USER_FOLDER/data/dumps are the downloaded websites
- settings.USER_FOLDER/data/jsons are the connection results for every request

# NOTES
- Deduplication is not 100% safe, sometimes pages are downloaded multiple times, and skipped in file check. 
On ~10 domains, check duplication has small delay. But on 10000 domains after 500k links, the domain list is so big that checking if a link is already downloaded or not was decreasing considerably the speed (from 30000 urls/min to 300 urls/min). That's why I preferred avoid a list, and left just "check file".
