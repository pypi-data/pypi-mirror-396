## Documentation

API reference documentation is available [here](https://developer.anduril.com/).

## Requirements

To use the SDK please ensure you have the following installed:

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/doc/versions)

## Installation

```sh
pip install anduril-lattice-sdk
```

## Support

For support with this library please reach out to your Anduril representative.

## Reference

A full reference for this library is available [here](https://github.com/anduril/lattice-sdk-python/blob/HEAD/./reference.md).

## Usage

Instantiate and use the client with the following:

```python
from anduril import Lattice

client = Lattice(
    token="YOUR_TOKEN",
)
client.entities.long_poll_entity_events(
    session_token="sessionToken",
)
```

## Async Client

The SDK also exports an `async` client so that you can make non-blocking calls to our API. Note that if you are constructing an Async httpx client class to pass into this client, use `httpx.AsyncClient()` instead of `httpx.Client()` (e.g. for the `httpx_client` parameter of this client).

```python
import asyncio

from anduril import AsyncLattice

client = AsyncLattice(
    token="YOUR_TOKEN",
)


async def main() -> None:
    await client.entities.long_poll_entity_events(
        session_token="sessionToken",
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Exception Handling

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
will be thrown.

```python
from anduril.core.api_error import ApiError

try:
    client.entities.long_poll_entity_events(...)
except ApiError as e:
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.body)
```

## Streaming

The SDK supports streaming responses, as well, the response will be a generator that you can loop over.

```python
from anduril import Lattice

client = Lattice(
    token="YOUR_TOKEN",
)
response = client.entities.stream_entities()
for chunk in response.data:
    yield chunk
```

## Pagination

Paginated requests will return a `SyncPager` or `AsyncPager`, which can be used as generators for the underlying object.

```python
from anduril import Lattice

client = Lattice(
    token="YOUR_TOKEN",
)
response = client.objects.list_objects()
for item in response:
    yield item
# alternatively, you can paginate page-by-page
for page in response.iter_pages():
    yield page
```

```python
# You can also iterate through pages and access the typed response per page
pager = client.objects.list_objects(...)
for page in pager.iter_pages():
    print(page.response)  # access the typed response for each page
    for item in page:
        print(item)
```

## Advanced

### Access Raw Response Data

The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.with_raw_response` property.
The `.with_raw_response` property returns a "raw" client that can be used to access the `.headers` and `.data` attributes.

```python
from anduril import Lattice

client = Lattice(
    ...,
)
response = client.entities.with_raw_response.long_poll_entity_events(...)
print(response.headers)  # access the response headers
print(response.data)  # access the underlying object
pager = client.objects.list_objects(...)
print(pager.response)  # access the typed response for the first page
for item in pager:
    print(item)  # access the underlying object(s)
for page in pager.iter_pages():
    print(page.response)  # access the typed response for each page
    for item in page:
        print(item)  # access the underlying object(s)
with client.entities.with_raw_response.stream_entities(...) as response:
    print(response.headers)  # access the response headers
    for chunk in response.data:
        print(chunk)  # access the underlying object(s)
```

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
retry limit (default: 2).

A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

- [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
- [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
- [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `max_retries` request option to configure this behavior.

```python
client.entities.long_poll_entity_events(..., request_options={
    "max_retries": 1
})
```

### Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. You can configure this with a timeout option at the client or request level.

```python

from anduril import Lattice

client = Lattice(
    ...,
    timeout=20.0,
)


# Override timeout for a specific method
client.entities.long_poll_entity_events(..., request_options={
    "timeout_in_seconds": 1
})
```

### Custom Client

You can override the `httpx` client to customize it for your use-case. Some common use-cases include support for proxies
and transports.

```python
import httpx
from anduril import Lattice

client = Lattice(
    ...,
    httpx_client=httpx.Client(
        proxy="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```
