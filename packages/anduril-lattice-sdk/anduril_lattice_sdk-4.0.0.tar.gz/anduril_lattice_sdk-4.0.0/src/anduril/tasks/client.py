        By default, this returns the latest task version for each matching task from the manager's perspective.

        Parameters
        ----------
        page_token : typing.Optional[str]
            If set, returns results starting from the given pageToken.

        parent_task_id : typing.Optional[str]

        """
        Establishes a server streaming connection that delivers tasks to taskable agents for execution.

        This method creates a persistent connection from Tasks API to an agent, allowing the server
        to push tasks to the agent as they become available. The agent receives a stream of tasks that
        match its selector criteria (entity IDs).

        The stream delivers three types of requests:
        - ExecuteRequest: Contains a new task for the agent to execute
        - CancelRequest: Indicates a task should be canceled
        - CompleteRequest: Indicates a task should be completed

        This is the primary method for taskable agents to receive and process tasks in real-time.
        Agents should maintain this connection and process incoming tasks according to their capabilities.

        When an agent receives a task, it should update the task status using the UpdateStatus endpoint
        to provide progress information back to Tasks API.

        This is a long polling API that will block until a new task is ready for delivery. If no new task is
        available then the server will hold on to your request for up to 5 minutes, after that 5 minute timeout
        period you will be expected to reinitiate a new request.

        Parameters
        ----------
        agent_selector : typing.Optional[EntityIdsSelector]
            Selector criteria to determine which Agent Tasks the agent receives

    ) -> TaskQueryResults:
        """
        Searches for Tasks that match specified filtering criteria and returns matching tasks in paginated form.

        This method allows filtering tasks based on multiple criteria including:
        - Parent task relationships
        - Task status (with inclusive or exclusive filtering)
        - Update time ranges
        - Task view (manager or agent perspective)
        - Task assignee
        - Task type (via exact URL matches or prefix matching)

        Results are returned in pages. When more results are available than can be returned in a single
        response, a page_token is provided that can be used in subsequent requests to retrieve the next
        set of results.

        By default, this returns the latest task version for each matching task from the manager's perspective.

        Parameters
        ----------
        page_token : typing.Optional[str]
            If set, returns results starting from the given pageToken.

        parent_task_id : typing.Optional[str]
            If present matches Tasks with this parent Task ID.
            Note: this is mutually exclusive with all other query parameters, for example, either provide parent task ID, or
            any of the remaining parameters, but not both.

        status_filter : typing.Optional[TaskQueryStatusFilter]

        update_time_range : typing.Optional[TaskQueryUpdateTimeRange]
            If provided, only provides Tasks updated within the time range.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        TaskQueryResults
            Task query was successful

    ) -> AgentRequest:
        """
        Establishes a server streaming connection that delivers tasks to taskable agents for execution.

        This method creates a persistent connection from Tasks API to an agent, allowing the server
        to push tasks to the agent as they become available. The agent receives a stream of tasks that
        match its selector criteria (entity IDs).

        The stream delivers three types of requests:
        - ExecuteRequest: Contains a new task for the agent to execute
        - CancelRequest: Indicates a task should be canceled
        - CompleteRequest: Indicates a task should be completed

        This is the primary method for taskable agents to receive and process tasks in real-time.
        Agents should maintain this connection and process incoming tasks according to their capabilities.

        When an agent receives a task, it should update the task status using the UpdateStatus endpoint
        to provide progress information back to Tasks API.

        This is a long polling API that will block until a new task is ready for delivery. If no new task is
        available then the server will hold on to your request for up to 5 minutes, after that 5 minute timeout
        period you will be expected to reinitiate a new request.

        Parameters
        ----------
        agent_selector : typing.Optional[EntityIdsSelector]
            Selector criteria to determine which Agent Tasks the agent receives

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        AgentRequest
            Requests for the agent to comply with.

        --------
