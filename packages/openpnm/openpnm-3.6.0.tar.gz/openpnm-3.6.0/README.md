# Overview of OpenPNM

OpenPNM is a framework for performing pore network simulations of porous materials.

## More Information

For more details about the package can be found in the [online documentation](https://openpnm.org)

## Installation and Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> We no longer support macOS on x86_64 (Intel) systems. A few dependencies—`triangle` among them—are no longer maintained there, and that breaks our build. These packages are mostly optional, though, so if you need OpenPNM on that platform, you can still build it from source.

### [pip](https://pypi.org/project/openpnm/)

OpenPNM can be installed using `pip` by running the following command in a terminal:

```shell
pip install openpnm
```

### [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openpnm)

OpenPNM can also be installed from the [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openpnm) repository using:

```shell
conda install conda-forge::openpnm
```

### For developers

For developers who intend to change the source code or contribute to OpenPNM, the source code can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/) and installed by running:

```shell
pip install -e 'path/to/downloaded/files'
```

The advantage of installing from the source code is that you can edit the files and have access to your changes each time you import OpenPNM.

OpenPNM requires the Scipy Stack (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, etc), which is most conveniently obtained by installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

## Asking Questions and Getting Help

Github now has a [Discussions](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/discussions) function, which works similarly to [stack overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).  Please post your question in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A) so devs or users can provide answers, vote on accepted answers, improve on each other's answers, and generally discuss things. Most importantly, all answers are searchable so eventually, once enough questions have been posted and answered, you can find what you're looking for with a simple search.

## Contact

OpenPNM is developed by the Porous Materials Engineering and Analysis Lab [(PMEAL)](http://pmeal.com), in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

The lead developer for this project is Prof. Jeff Gostick (<jgostick@gmail.com>).
