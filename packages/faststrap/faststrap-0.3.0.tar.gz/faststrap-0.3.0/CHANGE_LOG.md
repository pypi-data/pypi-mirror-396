[0.3.0]: https://github.com/Evayoung/Faststrap/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Local Bootstrap assets (`bootstrap.min.css`, `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`, icons, etc.) are now correctly included in the PyPI wheel when `use_cdn=False`. Previously, offline/local mode resulted in missing styles and broken JavaScript (modals, drawers, toasts).  
  → All local assets now work out of the box with no extra setup.
- Fixed a `mypy` type error when mounting static files by properly handling `importlib.resources.files(...).as_posix()` and casting `Traversable` objects for `StaticFiles`.

### Added
- **Developer Templates** — New `src/faststrap/templates/` directory with:
  - `component_template.py` → Boilerplate for rapid, consistent component development
  - `test_file_template.py` → Standardized pytest template with `to_xml()` assertions and HTMX/data-attribute tests
- These templates enforce FastStrap’s coding standards and dramatically speed up contribution.

### Changed
- **Packaging Improvement**: Moved the `static/` directory into `src/faststrap/static/`  
  → Ensures assets are reliably included in built wheels/sdists (modern Python packaging best practice).
- **Component Organization**: Reorganized components into clearly defined categories:
  - `forms/` → Buttons, inputs, groups
  - `display/` → Badges, cards
  - `feedback/` → Alerts, toasts, modals
  - `navigation/` → Navbar, drawer/offcanvas
  - `layout/` → Container, Row, Col  
  → Much easier for contributors to navigate and extend.

This release significantly improves reliability in offline/air-gapped environments and sets a strong foundation for community contributions and long-term maintainability.

### Improved

- Theme switching via HTMX POST request
