========== Setup ==========

=== 1st time
install rust:            https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/
cd to whichever directory you want this guy in
git clone https://github.com/NCSU-High-Powered-Rocketry-Club/High-Powered-Rocketry-Modeling.git
cd High-Powered-Rocketry-Modeling/hprm
uv tool install maturin                       # maturin can build rust crate as a python library
python -m venv .env                           # Python virtual environment for this project

=== every time
source .env/bin/activate        # Gets you into the local python virtual environmant


========== Use ==========

=== To compile code
(for fast developmentV)
maturin develop                 # Builds and adds to python venv automatically
    --OR--
(for a persistent library)
maturin build                   # Builds rust and creates wheel in your target folder
pip install target/wheels/...   # Tells python about the package

=== To run code
python3 demoy.py                # sample script meant to showcase the library's functionality
