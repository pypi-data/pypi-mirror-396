# ⚓ Honest Anchor

**git commit, but to the universe.**

Your code, carved in Bitcoin. Permanent. Public. Provable.

```bash
pip install honest-anchor

anchor init
anchor commit my-brilliant-algorithm.py

✓ Carved in Bitcoin. Proof ready in 1 hour.
```

---

## Why?

```
Paper burns.
Servers crash.
Git commits can be faked.

Bitcoin doesn't burn.
Bitcoin doesn't crash.
Bitcoin can't be faked.

Carve it. Forever.
```

- 🪨 **Permanent proof** — Your code existed at this exact moment
- 🌍 **Public record** — Anyone can verify, anytime
- 🔗 **Bitcoin-backed** — The most secure ledger on Earth
- 🆓 **Free to use** — We believe proof should be accessible

---

## How It Works

```
Your Code → SHA256 Hash → Bitcoin Block → Forever
```

1. Your file gets a unique fingerprint (SHA256 hash)
2. That fingerprint is carved into Bitcoin via [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org)
3. ~1-2 hours later, it's confirmed in a Bitcoin block
4. You have permanent, verifiable proof your file existed

Like writing on a wall that the whole world maintains and nobody can erase.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install honest-anchor

# Initialize in your project
anchor init

# Carve a file into Bitcoin
anchor commit README.md

# Carve with a note (like signing your name)
anchor commit -m "My first algorithm ⚒️" algo.py

# See what you've carved
anchor status

# Verify a file hasn't changed
anchor verify README.md

# Check if Bitcoin has confirmed
anchor upgrade
```

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `anchor init` | Set up `.anchor/` in your project |
| `anchor commit <file>` | Carve a file into Bitcoin |
| `anchor commit --all` | Carve all files matching patterns |
| `anchor status` | See all your carved files |
| `anchor verify <file>` | Check if file matches its carving |
| `anchor history` | Timeline of everything you've carved |
| `anchor info <file>` | Details about a specific carving |
| `anchor upgrade` | Update pending → confirmed status |

---

## What This Proves

✅ Your file **existed** at this specific moment in time
✅ Your file **hasn't changed** since it was carved
✅ You have **cryptographic proof** anyone can verify

---

## What This Doesn't Prove

❌ You **wrote** the file (that's authorship)
❌ You **own** the IP (that's legal ownership)
❌ This is a **patent** (that's legal protection)

*For full legal protection, consult an IP attorney. But having proof of prior art can invalidate patents!*

---

## Use Cases

**"I had this idea first"**
```bash
anchor commit idea.md -m "My startup idea, Dec 2025"
# Now you can prove it existed before anyone else claims it
```

**"This code is mine"**
```bash
anchor commit algorithm.py -m "Novel sorting algorithm"
# Prior art proof if someone tries to patent it
```

**"We agreed to this"**
```bash
anchor commit contract.pdf -m "Agreement with Acme Corp"
# Proof the document existed in this exact form
```

**"My AI created this"**
```bash
anchor commit ai-output.py -m "Generated by Claude, verified by me"
# Timestamp AI-generated code with human verification
```

---

## Configuration

Edit `.anchor/config.yml`:

```yaml
# Auto-carve these files
auto_anchor:
  - "*.py"
  - "*.md"
  - "*.js"
  - "!node_modules/**"
  - "!.git/**"

# Your signature
author: "Your Name"
email: "you@example.com"
```

---

## Git Integration

**Git tracks WHAT. Anchor proves WHEN. Together = complete proof.**

```
git commit   → saves your changes locally
anchor commit → proves they existed at this moment

git + anchor = WHAT you did + WHEN you did it
```

### Automatic Anchoring (Pre-commit Hook)

Every git commit automatically carves your code in Bitcoin:

```bash
# Create the hook
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Anchor all staged files to Bitcoin before committing
anchor commit --all --staged

# Optional: fail commit if anchoring fails
# exit $?
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Alternative: Post-commit Hook

Anchor after the commit (doesn't block your workflow):

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Anchor the committed files in the background
anchor commit --all &
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### One-liner Setup

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash\nanchor commit --all --staged' > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now every `git commit` = automatic Bitcoin timestamp. You don't even have to think about it.

---

## The Philosophy

```
git commit saves to your repo.
anchor commit saves to the universe.

Your repo can be deleted.
The universe can't.

100,000+ Bitcoin nodes across the world
maintain an unchangeable record.
No government, no company, no person can alter it.

git commit -m "my idea"     → saved locally
anchor commit -m "my idea"  → saved forever
```
