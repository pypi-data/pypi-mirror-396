# Overview

Welcome to the {{ graft_name }} graft. This starter shows how to ship a small Python package and surface it in Quarto content (including notebooks).

## What's inside

- uv-managed project with a package at `src/{{ package_name }}/`
- Quarto site with navbar/sidebar and a **pre-rendered** demo notebook
- Simple helpers exported from the package

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync
uv run quarto render docs --no-execute
```

Then open `_site/index.html` or run `make preview`.

## Use the package

```python
from {{ package_name }} import greet, show_dataframe
greet("Quarto")

show_dataframe()
```d

See `notebook.ipynb` for a jupyter notebook example.
