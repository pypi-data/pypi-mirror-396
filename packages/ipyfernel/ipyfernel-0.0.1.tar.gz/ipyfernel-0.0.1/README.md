# ipy*fern*el 🔥


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

### Choice of Name

It’s a remote kernel, so this is a play on words: `ipykernel` + the
German word/prefix “fern” meaning “remote” as in Fernseher for
television (lit: “remote viewer”). Plus maybe it sounds a bit like
“infernal,” which is 🔥
