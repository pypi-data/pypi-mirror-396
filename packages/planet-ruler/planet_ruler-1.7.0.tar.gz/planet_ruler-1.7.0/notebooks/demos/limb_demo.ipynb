    "### Posteriors\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this section you need to know a bit about what minimizer we used to solve the problem. This is using something called [differential evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution). It's a (terribly named) way of minimizing a loss function that is non-differentiable. Basically it simulates the 'evolution' of a population composed of parameter value sets. So [r=1, h=2, etc.] could be one unit of the population. These units are mutated and combined over many generations where only the best-fitting survive. When we end the simulation we have an optimal parameter set and a population that is hopefully still competitive. We can think of that population as something like a 'posterior', or measure of uncertainty in each parameter's observed value. Another totally valid method of optimization would have been a Bayesian MCMC and it would also give us posterior distributions that we could check out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we plot all these populations/posteriors and see if they look good. What is good? Ideally they should form a concave U-shape around the best value and not be too much up against either of the limits we imposed in the fit. If the latter is taking place, we might not be reaching the true minimum and it's hard to take the results too seriously. In that case, try the fit again but move the constraints out a little to give the fit some breathing room. I say a little bit because you don't want to make the constraints too wide either -- there really is a sweet spot that doesn't explicitly block the best parameter values, but gives the minimizer enough to work with that it can arrive there in our lifetimes.\n",
