"""
FreeDyn Python Bindings

Professional Python interface to FreeDyn multi-body dynamics simulator.

Quick Start:
    >>> import freedyn as fd
    >>> fd.initialize()
    >>> with fd.Model('model.fds') as model:
    ...     model.solve()
    ...     for time_idx, time, states in model.iterate_time_steps():
    ...         forces = fd.analysis.get_physical_dof_vector('SUMOFALLFORCES', time, states)

Main Classes:
    - Model: High-level interface for simulations
    - ModelInfo: Model information container

Functions:
    - initialize(): Load and initialize freedyn.dll (with legacy fallback)
    
Submodules:
    - analysis: Advanced analysis (matrices, vectors, Jacobians)
    - exceptions: Custom exception classes
