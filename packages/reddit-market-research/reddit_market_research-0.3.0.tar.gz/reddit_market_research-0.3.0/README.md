## Claude Code Workflow

This tool is designed to be used with Claude Code for market research on GitHub repos:

```
User: "Research market opportunities for https://github.com/neonwatty/seating-arrangement"

Claude Code:
  1. Fetches repo README via WebFetch
  2. Analyzes project → generates keywords + subreddits
  3. Runs: reddit-market-research search -s "..." -k "..." --json
  4. Parses JSON results
  5. Summarizes opportunities for user
```

Example prompts:
- "Find Reddit discussions about problems my seating-arrangement tool could solve"
- "Search for potential users of my meme-search project"
- "What pain points do people have that my youtube-tools repo addresses?"
