I need a gitlab pipeline to automate the publish of a python library to pypi. As tools, I want to use poetry for project management and commitizen(python) for version controlling. There are three type of branches:
- ~main~, which is where release are published
- ~release~, which is the branch which automatically merges from and to main.
- Any other, which are intermediate branches.
There are the following jobs:
1. Test, using poetry environment, on every branch.
2. Merge to main, if the branch is ~release~ and has passed the tests. It included pushing to repository
3. Publish to pypi, if the branch is ~main~ and has passed the tests:
   1. Bump release
   2. Push the tag and commit
   3. Publish to pypi
