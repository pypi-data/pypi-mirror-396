## Memory-Enhanced Development Series

A 4-part series exploring what becomes possible when AI can remember and learn.

| Part | Title | Key Result |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | [We Tested Memory on Our Own Codebase](01-we-tested-memory-on-our-own-codebase.md) | 78.7% security noise reduction |
| 2 | [Bug Correlation Deep Dive](02-bug-correlation-deep-dive.md) | 4 historical matches with proven fixes |
| 3 | [Tech Debt Trajectory Deep Dive](03-tech-debt-trajectory-deep-dive.md) | Projections showing 472 items in 90 days |
| 4 | [Security Learning Deep Dive](04-security-learning-deep-dive.md) | 85 findings suppressed via team decisions |

## The Core Insight

> **Scanning is easy. Learning is hard. And learning requires remembering.**

Without persistent memory:
- Bug correlation: 0 matches (starts from zero every time)
- Tech debt: Just a number (no trend, no prediction)
- Security: Same 108 findings every scan

With persistent memory:
- Bug correlation: 4 matches with proven fixes
- Tech debt: Trajectory analysis, 90-day projections
- Security: 23 findings after 78.7% noise reduction

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install empathy-framework

# Run the full repo test (validates all features)
python examples/full_repo_test.py

# Or try individual demos
