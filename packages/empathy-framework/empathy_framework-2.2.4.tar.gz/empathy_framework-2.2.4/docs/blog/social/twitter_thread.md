**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
We tested our AI memory system on our own codebase.

Results:
• Bug correlation: 4 historical matches with proven fixes
• Tech debt: +14.3% growth, doubles in 239 days
• Security: 78.7% noise reduction

Here's what we learned about persistent memory 🧵

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
The problem with AI coding assistants: amnesia.

Sarah fixes a bug in September.
Mike hits the same pattern in December.
Mike's AI has no idea.

Every session starts from zero.

**Tweet 3 (Bug Correlation)**
Bug Pattern Correlation:

We stored 4 historical bug patterns.
Threw 3 "new" bugs at the system.

Result: 4 matches found.
Each with the fix that worked + time estimate.

"This looks like what @sarah fixed 3 months ago. Here's what worked."

**Tweet 4 (Tech Debt)**
Tech Debt Trajectory:

Before: "343 items found"

After:
• 343 items (up from 300 last month)
• +14.3% monthly growth
• Projected 472 in 90 days
• Doubles in 239 days

A number is data. A trajectory is intelligence.

**Tweet 5 (Security)**
Security Learning:

Before: 108 findings every scan
After: 23 findings

78.7% noise reduction.

We recorded 3 team decisions:
• "Test fixtures aren't real secrets"
• "ORM handles SQL escaping"
• "Random for UI isn't crypto"

Review once. AI remembers.

**Tweet 6 (Insight)**
The insight:

Scanning is easy.
Learning is hard.
Learning requires remembering.

Every AI tool can scan your code.
None of them learn from it.

**Tweet 8 (Engagement)**
Questions I'm curious about:

1. How does your team share debugging knowledge today?

2. Do you track tech debt trends or just point-in-time counts?

3. What's the worst false positive fatigue you've experienced?
