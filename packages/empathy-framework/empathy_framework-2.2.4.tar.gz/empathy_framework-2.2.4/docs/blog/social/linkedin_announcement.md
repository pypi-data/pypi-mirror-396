**We tested our AI memory system on our own codebase. Here's what we found.**

Every AI coding assistant has the same problem: amnesia.

Sarah fixes a bug in September. Mike hits the same pattern in December. Mike's AI has no idea. So Mike wastes 30 minutes solving what Sarah already knew.

We built persistent memory for dev tools and tested it on our own repo:

**Bug Correlation**
→ 4 historical matches found
→ Each with proven fixes from team history
→ "This looks like what @sarah fixed 3 months ago"

**Tech Debt Trajectory**
→ 343 items today
→ +14.3% monthly growth
→ Projected 472 in 90 days
→ A number becomes a trend

**Security Learning**
→ 108 findings every scan
→ 23 after learning team decisions
→ 78.7% noise reduction
→ Stop reviewing the same false positives

The insight: Scanning is easy. Learning is hard. Learning requires remembering.

## Alternative Hook Versions

**Version B (question lead):**
How does your team share debugging knowledge?

We realized ours was scattered across Slack threads, Notion pages, and people's heads. So we built memory into our AI tools...

**Version C (data lead):**
78.7% noise reduction on security scans.

That's what happened when we taught our AI to remember team decisions about false positives...

**Version D (problem lead):**
Alert fatigue is real.

Our security scanner flagged 108 issues every single scan. The same false positives. Every time. So we built learning...
