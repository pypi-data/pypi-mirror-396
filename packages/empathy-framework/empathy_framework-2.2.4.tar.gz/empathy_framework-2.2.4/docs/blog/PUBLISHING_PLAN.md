## Platform-Specific Notes

### Reddit
- **First 2 hours are critical** — algorithm boosts posts with early engagement
- **Don't delete/repost** — looks spammy, can get shadowbanned
- **Be genuine** — Reddit hates obvious marketing, frame as sharing what you built
- **Answer questions thoroughly** — builds credibility

### LinkedIn
- **Best times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 12-2pm
- **Tag people** who might find it relevant
- **Use line breaks** — wall of text gets ignored
- **End with question** — drives comments

### Twitter/X
- **Thread format** works well for technical content
- **Include visuals** — code snippets as images, terminal output
- **Pin main thread** to profile during launch week

### Hacker News
- **Unpredictable** — great content can flop, mediocre content can hit front page
- **"Show HN"** format for projects you built
- **Don't over-promote** — one post, let it sink or swim
- **Be extremely responsive** if it gets traction

### Dev.to
- **Lower traffic** than Reddit but highly targeted
- **Cross-posting is accepted** — republish blog posts with canonical URL
- **Good for SEO** — posts get indexed well

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Reddit upvotes | 50+ on main post | Indicates resonance |
| Reddit comments | 20+ | Engagement depth |
| GitHub stars | +25 during launch week | Direct conversion |
| Blog views | 500+ | Track with analytics |
| LinkedIn impressions | 1000+ | Broader reach indicator |

---

## Contingency Plans

**If r/Python post flops (<10 upvotes after 4 hours):**
- Don't delete — leave it
- Focus energy on LinkedIn and Dev.to instead
- Try r/programming the next day with different angle

**If post gets controversial/negative feedback:**
- Respond professionally, acknowledge valid criticism
- Don't get defensive
- Use feedback to improve messaging

**If it takes off unexpectedly:**
- Be ready to handle GitHub issues/questions
- Have demo environment ready for live debugging if needed
- Consider accelerating follow-up content schedule

---

## Post-Launch (Week of Dec 23)

- r/programming main post (Tuesday Dec 24 or Thursday Dec 26)
- Security follow-up post
- Consider r/netsec or r/devops for security-focused content
- Evaluate Product Hunt timing (January might be better than holiday week)

---
