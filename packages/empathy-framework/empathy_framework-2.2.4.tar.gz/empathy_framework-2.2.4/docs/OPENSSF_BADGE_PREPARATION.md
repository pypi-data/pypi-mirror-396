## Answering OpenSSF Questions

### Quality Questions

**Q: Do you have an automated test suite?**
A: Yes. We use pytest with 1,247 comprehensive tests covering core functionality, wizards, plugins, LLM providers, and integrations. Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions on every push and pull request with zero flaky tests.

**Q: What is your test coverage?**
A: Currently **83.13% statement coverage** with 1,247 passing tests. We **EXCEEDED the 70% Strong Beta target** by 13.13 percentage points. We have a documented plan to reach 90%+ (Production/Stable) in 2-3 weeks with only 229 lines remaining (6.87% gap). Recent progress includes 360 comprehensive tests added across 5 systematic phases. Coverage reports are generated via pytest-cov with detailed analysis in COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md. We achieved 24 files at 100% coverage including complete LLM toolkit coverage.

**Q: Do you have a continuous integration system?**
A: Yes. GitHub Actions runs tests, linting (Ruff, Black), security scanning (Bandit), and coverage reporting on every push and pull request.

**Q: Do your builds compile without warnings?**
A: Yes. All linting and static analysis tools report clean builds. We use strict Ruff configuration and Black formatting.

### Security Questions

**Q: How do you handle vulnerability reports?**
A: Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to patrick.roebuck@deepstudyai.com with subject line "[SECURITY]". We commit to 48-hour acknowledgment and 5-day initial assessment. See SECURITY.md.

**Q: Do you use static analysis tools?**
A: Yes. We use:
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Bandit**: Security-focused static analysis
- **MyPy**: Type checking (partial)

All tools run in pre-commit hooks and CI.

**Q: Do you fix known vulnerabilities?**
A: Yes. All dependencies are regularly updated. No known CVEs exist in our dependency tree. We use automated security scanning via Bandit and plan to add Snyk/Dependabot.

### Documentation Questions

**Q: Is there documentation on how to contribute?**
A: Yes. CONTRIBUTING.md provides guidelines for:
- Setting up development environment
- Running tests
- Code style requirements
- Pull request process
- Licensing (Fair Source 0.9)

**Q: Are there usage examples?**
A: Yes. The examples/ directory contains real-world usage examples for both healthcare and software development wizards. Each wizard class also includes docstrings with usage examples.

### Licensing Questions

**Q: What is your license?**
A: Dual licensing:
1. **Fair Source 0.9** (LICENSE): Free for ≤5 employees, students, educators
2. **Commercial License** (LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md): $99/developer/year for 6+ employees

**Q: Is the license OSI-approved?**
A: Fair Source 0.9 is not OSI-approved (it's source-available, not fully open source). However, it's a recognized ethical license for sustainable commercial open source.
