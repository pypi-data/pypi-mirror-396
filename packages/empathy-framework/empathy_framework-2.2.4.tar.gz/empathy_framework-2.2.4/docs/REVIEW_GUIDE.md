## Known Items to Verify

### Critical (Must Fix Before Publishing)
1. **GitHub Organization Name**: Currently set to `deepstudy-ai`
   - Is this your actual GitHub org?
   - Or should it be a different name?

2. **Contact Information**:
   - Email: hello@deepstudy.ai
   - Twitter: @deepstudy_ai
   - Do these exist? Are they correct?

3. **Newsletter Signup**: README mentions "https://deepstudy.ai/newsletter (coming soon)"
   - Is this real or placeholder?

### Important (Should Verify)
4. **Timeline**: Q1 2026 for full book
   - Still accurate?
   - Or should it be different date?

5. **Productivity Stats**:
   - 3x faster (120 hours → 40 hours)
   - 18 wizards in 15 weeks
   - 5,680 hours saved over 3 years
   - Are these exact numbers accurate?

6. **Academic Partnership**: README mentions "MIT CSAIL, Stanford HAI, CMU HCII, UC Berkeley BAIR"
   - Are these aspirational or actual partnerships?
   - Should say "Target Institutions" (currently does)

### Optional (Nice to Verify)
7. **Code Examples**: Do they compile/run?
   - Not critical for book preview
   - But should be syntactically correct

8. **Healthcare Details**: Joint Commission audit timing
   - Is 3-year cycle accurate?
   - Is 90-day prep window realistic?
