## 💬 Response Templates

**"How is this different from static analysis?"**
→ Static analysis works within a single domain. This learns patterns from healthcare and applies them to software—cross-domain reasoning no other tool can do.

**"87% confidence seems high"**
→ Based on semantic similarity between domains, source research quality (healthcare handoffs are well-documented), and matching vulnerability indicators. Working demo shows methodology.

**"Why not fully open source?"**
→ Fair Source balances free access (students, small teams) with sustainable development. Auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029.
