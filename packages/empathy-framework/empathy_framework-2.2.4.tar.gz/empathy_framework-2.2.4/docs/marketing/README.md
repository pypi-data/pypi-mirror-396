# Empathy Framework - Launch Content Hub

**Status:** ✅ Ready for launch (refreshed December 2025)
**Target Audience:** Developers, DevOps teams, enterprise teams, CTOs

---

## Key Messaging

All content uses the unified **5 Problems / 6 Solutions** framework:

### The Problem Statement
> "Today's AI tools are brilliant but broken for enterprise use."

**5 Problems:**
1. **Stateless** — forget everything between sessions
2. **Cloud-dependent** — data leaves your infrastructure
3. **Isolated** — can't coordinate with other agents
4. **Reactive** — wait for problems instead of preventing them
5. **Expensive** — every query costs the same

### The Solution
> "Empathy solves all five."

**6 Solutions:**
1. Memory That Persists (git-based patterns + optional Redis)
2. Enterprise-Ready (local-first, compliance)
3. Anticipatory Intelligence (30-90 day predictions)
4. Build Better Agents (30+ wizards, toolkit)
5. Human↔AI & AI↔AI Orchestration
6. Performance & Cost (smart routing + no repeated context)

### Quick Start
```bash
pip install empathy-framework
empathy-memory serve
```

```

Demonstrates:
1. Bug Pattern Correlation - "This bug looks like one we fixed 3 months ago"
