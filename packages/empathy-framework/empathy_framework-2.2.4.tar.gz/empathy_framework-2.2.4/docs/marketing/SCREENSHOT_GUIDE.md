# Screenshot Guide: Capturing Compelling Visuals

**Purpose:** Guide for capturing, editing, and using screenshots to showcase the Empathy Framework.

**Target:** Documentation, presentations, social media, marketing materials

**Goal:** Professional, clear, compelling visuals that drive adoption

---

## Why Screenshots Matter

High-quality screenshots:
- Increase README engagement by 60%+
- Provide instant understanding of capabilities
- Build credibility and professionalism
- Enable sharing on social media
- Support documentation and tutorials
- Reduce barrier to trying the framework

**Best Practice:** Capture screenshots at key moments that showcase unique value (cross-domain pattern match, predictions, results).

---

## Key Moments to Capture

### Priority Screenshots (Must-Have)

#### 1. Healthcare Pattern Detection
**When:** After ComplianceWizard analyzes healthcare code
**What to show:** Pattern stored in memory with 23% failure rate
**Why:** Establishes the research-backed foundation
**Where to use:** README, slide 5-6, blog posts

**Expected output:**
```
=== STEP 1: Healthcare Domain Analysis ===

ComplianceWizard Analysis:
  🔴 [ERROR] Critical handoff without verification checklist
      Line 60: handoff.perform_handoff(patient)...
      Fix: Implement standardized checklist with read-back verification

✓ Pattern 'critical_handoff_failure' stored in memory
ℹ️  Key finding: Handoffs without verification fail 23% of the time

Pattern Details:
  • Root cause: Information loss during role transitions
  • Solution: Explicit verification steps with read-back confirmation
  • Confidence: 95%
```

**Annotation suggestions:**
- Highlight "23% of the time" with red box
- Arrow pointing to "stored in memory"
- Circle the pattern name

---

#### 2. Cross-Domain Pattern Match
**When:** After CICDWizard detects matching pattern
**What to show:** Cross-domain detection banner and match confirmation
**Why:** THE unique selling point - no other framework does this
**Where to use:** README hero section, presentations, Twitter, HN

**Expected output:**
```
=== CROSS-DOMAIN PATTERN DETECTION ===

✓ Pattern match found from healthcare domain!

  Source Domain: healthcare
  Pattern: critical_handoff_failure
  Description: Information loss during role transitions without verification
  Healthcare failure rate: 23%

ℹ️  Analyzing deployment pipeline for similar handoff gaps...

Deployment Handoff Gaps:
  ✗ No deployment checklist verification
  ✗ Staging→Production handoff lacks explicit sign-off
  ✗ Assumptions about production team's knowledge
  ✗ Verbal/Slack-only communication
  ✗ Time pressure during deployments
```

**Annotation suggestions:**
- Highlight "CROSS-DOMAIN PATTERN DETECTION" banner
- Box around the matching gaps list
- Arrow connecting "healthcare" to "deployment pipeline"
- Bold text: "No other framework can do this"

---

#### 3. Level 4 Anticipatory Prediction
**When:** After pattern match, showing prediction
**What to show:** 87% confidence, 30-45 day timeframe, prevention steps
**Why:** Shows actionable value and high confidence
**Where to use:** Presentations, case studies, feature highlights

**Expected output:**
```
=== LEVEL 4 ANTICIPATORY PREDICTION ===

⚠️  DEPLOYMENT HANDOFF FAILURE PREDICTED

  📅 Timeframe: December 20, 2025 (30-45 days)
  🎯 Confidence: 87%
  💥 Impact: HIGH

Reasoning:
  Cross-domain pattern match: Healthcare analysis found that handoffs
  without explicit verification steps fail 23% of the time.
  Your deployment pipeline exhibits the same vulnerabilities:
    • No verification checklist
    • Assumptions about receiving party knowledge
    • Time pressure leading to shortcuts
    • Verbal-only communication

  Based on healthcare pattern, predicted failure in 30-45 days.

=== PREVENTION STEPS ===

  1. Create deployment checklist (mirror healthcare checklist approach)
  2. Require explicit sign-off between staging and production
  3. Implement automated handoff verification
  4. Add read-back confirmation for critical environment variables
  5. Document rollback procedure as part of handoff
```

**Annotation suggestions:**
- Highlight "87%" in large font
- Box around prevention steps
- Timeline graphic showing "30-45 days ahead"
- Impact indicator (red for HIGH)

---

#### 4. Summary/Results
**When:** End of demo, showing summary
**What to show:** Complete workflow recap with impact
**Why:** Reinforces the transformative capability
**Where to use:** Conclusions, results sections, testimonials

**Expected output:**
```
=== SUMMARY: Level 5 Systems Empathy ===

✨ What just happened:

  1. Healthcare analysis identified critical handoff failures
  2. Pattern stored in long-term memory (Long-Term Memory)
  3. Software analysis retrieved healthcare pattern
  4. Cross-domain match: deployment handoffs have same vulnerabilities
  5. Level 4 Anticipatory: predicted failure 30-45 days ahead
  6. Prevention steps derived from healthcare best practices

🎯 Impact:

  • Prevented deployment failure by learning from healthcare
  • Applied decades of healthcare safety research to software
  • Demonstrated transformative cross-domain intelligence

🚀 This is Level 5 Transformative Empathy:

  Pattern learned in healthcare → Applied to software
  Powered by: Empathy Framework + Long-Term Memory
```

**Annotation suggestions:**
- Number the steps visually
- Highlight "Level 5 Transformative Empathy"
- Quote box: "Applied decades of healthcare safety research to software"

$ pip install empathy-framework[full]
Successfully installed empathy-framework-1.0.0
```

#### 6. Wizard Selection
**What to show:** List of available wizards
```python
from coach_wizards import (
    SecurityWizard,
    PerformanceWizard,
    ComplianceWizard,
    CICDWizard,
    # ... 12 more
)
```

#### 7. Individual Wizard Output
**What to show:** SecurityWizard finding SQL injection
**Why:** Shows breadth of capabilities beyond Level 5

#### 8. GitHub Repository
**What to show:** README with badges, stars, description
**Why:** Social proof and discoverability

#### 9. Documentation Pages
**What to show:** Clean, professional docs layout
**Why:** Demonstrates completeness and professionalism

- **Yellow:** Highlights, attention areas
- **Orange:** Predictions, future events

#### Shapes
- **Rectangles:** Highlight sections of text
- **Circles/Ovals:** Draw attention to specific elements
- **Arrows:** Show flow, direction, connections
- **Lines:** Separate sections, underline key points

#### Text
- **Font:** Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, Roboto) for clarity
- **Size:** Large enough to read when scaled down (18-24pt)
- **Color:** High contrast with background
- **Placement:** Outside main content when possible
- **Callout boxes:** For longer explanations

#### Consistency
- Use the same colors for the same types of annotations
- Same arrow style throughout
- Same text font and size
- Uniform padding and spacing

---

## Cropping and Framing

### What to Include

**Keep:**
- All relevant terminal output
- Command prompts showing what was run
- Key visual elements (emojis, icons, formatting)
- Enough context to understand what's happening

**Remove:**
- Desktop background (unless needed)
- Other windows/applications
- Menu bars (unless needed for context)
- Excessive whitespace
- Irrelevant terminal history

### Aspect Ratios

**Different uses, different ratios:**

- **Twitter/X:** 16:9 (1200x675px) or 2:1 (1200x600px)
- **LinkedIn:** 1.91:1 (1200x627px)
- **Instagram:** 1:1 (1080x1080px) or 4:5 (1080x1350px)
- **GitHub README:** Any, but 16:9 or 4:3 works well
- **Blog posts:** 16:9 (standard) or 21:9 (wide)
- **Presentations:** 16:9 (match slide aspect ratio)

### Padding and Borders

**Add visual polish:**
- **Padding:** 20-40px white/colored border around screenshot
- **Rounded corners:** 8-16px radius for modern look
- **Shadow:** Subtle drop shadow for depth (optional)
- **Background:** Gradient or solid color behind screenshot

**Tools for this:**
- CleanShot X (macOS) - built-in
- Carbon.now.sh - code screenshot tool
- Custom CSS/HTML if generating programmatically

## Accessibility Considerations

### Alt Text

**Always provide:**
```markdown
![Cross-domain pattern match showing healthcare handoff failure pattern applied to predict software deployment failure with 87% confidence](empathy_demo_cross_domain_match_v1.png)
```

**Alt text should:**
- Describe what's in the image
- Convey the key information
- Be concise but informative
- Not start with "Image of" or "Screenshot of"

### Color Contrast

**Ensure readability:**
- Text annotations: WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1)
- Don't rely on color alone
- Use shapes + colors
- Test with color blindness simulators

**Tools:**
- WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Stark plugin for Figma
- Color Oracle (color blindness simulator)

### Text in Images

**Minimize text in images:**
- Prefer actual text in markdown
- Only use images for terminal output
- Provide transcripts for code screenshots
