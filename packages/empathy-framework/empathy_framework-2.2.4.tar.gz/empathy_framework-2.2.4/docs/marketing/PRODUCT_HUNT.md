## Product Details

### Product Name
**Empathy Framework**

### Tagline (60 characters max)
AI collaboration with persistent memory and multi-agent orchestration

**Alternatives:**
- Enterprise AI that remembers, coordinates, and predicts
- Local-first AI framework with memory and anticipation

### Short Description (120 characters)
The AI collaboration framework that predicts problems before they happen. Persistent memory. Local-first. Multi-agent ready.

---

## Full Description

### Paragraph 1: The Problem
Today's AI tools are brilliant but broken for enterprise use. They forget everything between sessions. Your data leaves your infrastructure. They can't coordinate with other agents. They wait for problems instead of preventing them. And every query costs the same regardless of complexity.

### Paragraph 2: The Solution
Empathy Framework solves all five. Dual-layer memory — git-based pattern storage for long-term knowledge (zero infrastructure required) plus optional Redis for real-time coordination — means AI that learns across sessions. Local-first architecture keeps your data on your infrastructure. Built-in multi-agent orchestration through Empathy OS. Anticipatory intelligence predicts issues 30-90 days ahead. Smart cost routing plus persistent memory means no more wasting tokens re-explaining context.

### Paragraph 3: What's Included
30+ production wizards for security, performance, testing, documentation, accessibility, and compliance. Agent toolkit to build custom agents that inherit memory, trust, and anticipation. Healthcare suite with HIPAA-compliant patterns. Works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, or your own models.

### Paragraph 4: Quick Start
Two commands to get started: `pip install empathy-framework` and `empathy-memory serve`. Redis starts, API server runs, memory system ready. Fair Source licensed—free for small teams, affordable for commercial use.

## Key Features (7 bullets)

1. **Persistent Memory** — Dual-layer architecture: git-based pattern storage (zero infrastructure, version-controlled), optional Redis for real-time coordination

2. **Local-First** — Your data stays on your infrastructure. Nothing leaves your control. Built-in compliance patterns for HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2

3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Empathy OS manages human↔AI and AI↔AI collaboration with trust management and conflict resolution

4. **Anticipatory Intelligence** — Predicts security vulnerabilities, performance degradation, and compliance gaps 30-90 days ahead

5. **30+ Production Wizards** — Security, performance, testing, documentation, accessibility, compliance—use or extend

6. **Real Cost Savings** — Smart routing (cheap models triage, capable models decide) plus persistent memory eliminates repeated context

7. **Fair Source Licensed** — Free for teams ≤5 employees, $99/dev/year commercial, auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029

## First Comment Template

**Title:** Hey Product Hunt! Here's why I built this.

**Content:**

I've been building AI tools for healthcare and software development for years. The biggest frustration? Every session starts from zero.

Your AI doesn't remember the architecture decisions from yesterday. It doesn't know your team's coding patterns. It can't coordinate with other agents. It just waits for you to find problems instead of preventing them.

So I built Empathy Framework to fix that.

**The five problems we solve:**

1. **Stateless** — AI forgets everything between sessions
   → Dual-layer memory: Redis short-term + pattern storage long-term

2. **Cloud-dependent** — Your data leaves your infrastructure
   → Local-first. Nothing goes to external servers.

3. **Isolated** — AI can't coordinate
   → Empathy OS for multi-agent orchestration

4. **Reactive** — AI waits for problems
   → Anticipatory intelligence predicts 30-90 days ahead

5. **Expensive** — Every query costs the same, tokens wasted re-explaining context
   → Smart routing + persistent memory: no more re-teaching your AI

**Try it now:**

```bash
pip install empathy-framework
empathy-memory serve
```

Two commands. Redis starts, API server runs, memory system ready.

**What's included:**
- 30+ production wizards (security, performance, testing, docs)
- Agent toolkit to build your own
- Healthcare suite with HIPAA compliance
- Works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama

**Fair Source licensed:**
- Free for students, educators, teams ≤5
- $99/dev/year commercial
- Auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029

**I'd love your feedback on:**
1. What memory/coordination features would help your team?
2. How should this integrate with your workflow?
3. What wizards should we add next?

Happy to answer any questions!

## Response Templates

### Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT/Claude?
**A:** Those are stateless—they forget everything between sessions. Empathy adds persistent memory that learns across sessions, multi-agent coordination, anticipatory predictions, and local-first privacy. It's the infrastructure layer that makes AI tools enterprise-ready.

### Q: Does this work with my existing LLM provider?
**A:** Yes! Empathy works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API. The memory and orchestration layer sits on top of whatever LLM you choose.

### Q: What about privacy/security?
**A:** Local-first by design. Your data stays on your infrastructure. Built-in PII scrubbing, secrets detection, and audit logging. Compliance patterns for HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC2 included.

### Q: Why Fair Source instead of MIT/Apache?
**A:** Fair Source balances open access with sustainable development. Free forever for students, educators, and small teams. Commercial license funds continued development. And it auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029, so it will be fully open source in 4 years.

### Q: Can I contribute?
**A:** Yes! We welcome contributions. Check out the GitHub repo for contributing guidelines. Especially interested in new wizards, pattern libraries, and integrations.
