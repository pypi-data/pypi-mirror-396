## Claude Integration Features (All Tiers)

### 1. Extended Context Analysis
**Available in:** Pro, Business (requires Claude)

```python
# Analyze entire repository in one call
result = await claude.analyze_large_codebase(
    codebase_files=all_repo_files,  # 500+ files
    analysis_prompt="Find security vulnerabilities and predict scaling issues"
)
```

**Unique to Claude:** 200K context window
- **Competitor limits:** GPT-4 (128K), Gemini (32K)
- **Empathy Framework use case:** Whole-repo analysis without chunking

### 2. Prompt Caching (90% Cost Reduction)
**Available in:** Pro, Business (Claude-specific feature)

**How it works:**
- System prompts cached for 5 minutes
- Repeated security scans reuse cached context
- **Cost:** 90% reduction for repeated queries

**Example savings:**
- Traditional: $3 per 1M input tokens
- With caching: $0.30 per 1M cached tokens (10x cheaper)

**Framework optimization:**
- Pre-commit hooks trigger multiple scans
- Same codebase context cached across scans
- Typical user: 10-50 scans/day become affordable

### 3. Thinking Mode (Complex Reasoning)
**Available in:** Pro, Business (Claude 3.5+)

**Use case:** Level 4 Anticipatory predictions

```python
# Enable thinking mode for trajectory analysis
result = await claude.generate(
    messages=[...],
    use_thinking=True  # Claude shows reasoning
)

# Result includes:
# - Predicted issues
# - Reasoning process (visible)
# - Confidence scores
# - Timeline estimates
```

**Why it matters:**
- Transparency: See how Claude predicts future bugs
- Accuracy: Extended reasoning improves predictions
- Trust: Developers understand AI recommendations

### 4. Multi-Turn Wizard Conversations
**Available in:** All tiers (works better with Claude)

**Empathy Framework pattern:**
- Wizard asks clarifying questions
- User refines requirements
- Multiple analysis passes

**Claude advantage:**
- Better context retention across turns
- More nuanced follow-up questions
- Maintains coherence in long sessions

## FAQ: Multi-Provider Strategy

**Q: Why not exclusively use Claude?**
A: While Claude is our default and recommended provider, multi-provider support ensures:
- Enterprise customers can use existing LLM contracts
- Privacy-sensitive users can run local models
- We're not dependent on one vendor's pricing/policies
- Competition keeps us innovating

**Q: Does Anthropic benefit from non-Claude users?**
A: Yes! Every framework user sees Claude as the recommended provider. Many start with free tier (their own API key) but upgrade to Pro (Claude included) for convenience and optimization.

**Q: What if Claude API pricing changes?**
A: Our multi-provider architecture means we can adjust:
- Shift default to more cost-effective models
- Pass reasonable increases to users
- Negotiate volume discounts with Anthropic
- Users always have choice

**Q: How do Claude-specific features work with other providers?**
A: Framework gracefully degrades:
- Prompt caching → Standard mode with OpenAI/Gemini
- Extended context → Automatic chunking with smaller context windows
- Thinking mode → Standard generation (hidden reasoning)
- Large codebase analysis → Batched analysis with multiple calls
