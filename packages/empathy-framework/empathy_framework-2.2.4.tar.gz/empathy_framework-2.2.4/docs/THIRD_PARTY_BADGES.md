# Third-Party Certification & Badges

This guide explains third-party standards you can use to objectively certify your project's readiness for production use.

## 🏆 OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (Highly Recommended)

The **OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation) Best Practices Badge** is the gold standard for proving project maturity.

### Why It Matters
- **Trusted by enterprise**: Used by Linux Foundation, CNCF projects
- **Comprehensive assessment**: 60+ criteria covering security, quality, and governance
- **Public verification**: Anyone can see your compliance status
- **Multiple levels**: Passing → Silver → Gold

### How to Apply

1. **Visit**: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/
2. **Create account** and add your project
3. **Complete questionnaire** (60+ questions)
4. **Badge automatically updates** as you meet criteria

### Criteria Breakdown

#### ✅ **Passing Badge** (60+ criteria)
**Basics**:
- Public version control (GitHub) ✅
- Unique version numbers ✅
- Release notes ✅
- Website uses HTTPS ✅

**Change Control**:
- Public access to source ✅
- Bug reporting mechanism ✅
- Distributed version control ✅

**Quality**:
- Automated test suite ⚠️
- **Test coverage ≥ 90%** ⚠️
- Warnings-free builds ✅
- Static code analysis ✅

**Security**:
- Security vulnerability reporting process ❌ (Need SECURITY.md)
- Known vulnerabilities fixed ✅
- No unpatched vulnerabilities ✅

**Analysis**:
- Static analysis before release ✅
- Dynamic analysis tools ⚠️

#### ✅ **Silver Badge** (Additional 22 criteria)
- 2FA for project members
- Security assurance case
- Reproducible builds
- Perfect forward secrecy for downloads

#### ✅ **Gold Badge** (Additional criteria)
- Two independent security reviews
- No Medium+ vulnerabilities for 60+ days

### Current Gaps to Address

Based on your project:

1. **❌ Test Coverage**: Currently 14% minimum, need 90%+
   ```toml
   # pyproject.toml - UPDATE THIS:
   "--cov-fail-under=90",  # Change from 14
   ```

2. **❌ SECURITY.md**: Add security vulnerability reporting
   ```markdown
   # Create: SECURITY.md
   See template below
   ```

3. **⚠️ Dynamic Testing**: Add integration tests
4. **⚠️ Code Review**: Require PR reviews before merge

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  analysis:
    name: Scorecard analysis
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      id-token: write

    steps:
      - name: "Checkout code"
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: "Run analysis"
        uses: ossf/scorecard-action@v2
        with:
          results_file: results.sarif
          results_format: sarif
          publish_results: true

      - name: "Upload to code-scanning"
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif
```
