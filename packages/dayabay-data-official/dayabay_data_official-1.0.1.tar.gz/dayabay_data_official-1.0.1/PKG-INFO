## Summary

The repository contains the full (analysis) Daya Bay data set of inverse-beta-decay (IBD) candidates (reactor electron antineutrino interactions) with the final-state neutron captured on gadolinium. The dataset and supplementary data are sufficient to reproduce the measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters sin²2θ₁₃ and Δm²₃₂, published in [Phys.Rev.Lett. 130 (2023) 16, 161802](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.161802).

The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment took data from 2011 to 2020 in China. It obtained a sample of 5.55 million IBD events with the final-state neutron captured on gadolinium (nGd). This sample was collected by eight identically designed antineutrino detectors (AD) observing antineutrino flux from six nuclear power plants located at baselines between 400 m and 2 km. It covers 3158 days of operation.

Code is provided elsewhere to read the dataset and produce a measurement of sin²2θ₁₃ and Δm²₃₂, consistent with the publication.

## Citation statement

If you use the dataset, cite the following sources:

[1] [Daya Bay Collaboration, “Full Data Release of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment”, v1.0.0. Zenodo, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.17587229; 2025](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17587229).

## The dataset organization

The analysis dataset contains all the necessary inputs, needed to perform a measurement of sin²2θ₁₃ and Δm²₃₂. It is available in four different formats: hdf5, npz, root and tsv (plain text, compressed).

The detailed information on the contents of the files and formats is provided in one of dedicated readme files: [hdf5](src/dayabay_data_official/hdf5/README.md), [npz](src/dayabay_data_official/npz/README.md), [root](src/dayabay_data_official/root/README.md), [tsv](src/dayabay_data_official/tsv/README.md).

## Data availability

The main storage of the data is [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17587229).
A few alternative storage locations are available, including:

If you host a copy of the dataset, it should be supplemented with the current description.

## Feedback and contacts

It is advised to use discussions and issues of the [GitHub dataset repository](https://github.com/dayabay-experiment/dayabay-data-official) as a main channel to provide feedback or request additional details related to the dataset itself.

If a personal contact is desired, please, contact Zeyuan Yu (<yuzy@ihep.ac.cn>) and Maxim Gonchar (<gonchar@jinr.ru>).

## Analysis code

A dedicated python module [`dayabay-model`](https://github.com/dagflow-team/dayabay-model) is provided, which is able to read analysis data in any of the formats and provide predicted IBD spectra for each AD, the χ² function, or a result of any intermediate calculation. The module also contains a few minimal examples on how to work with the model and extract data from it. At this moment the latest version of `dayabay-model`, consistent with the dataset, is v0.4.2.

More comprehensive examples of the data analysis are available in [`dayabay-analysis`](https://github.com/dagflow-team/dayabay-analysis) repository. Commands to perform the oscillation fit to the full Daya Bay dataset is provided as well.

The code above depends on a few other Python modules, developed to support the analysis. The dependencies are automatically resolved via `pip` when the model is installed.
