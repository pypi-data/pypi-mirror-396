# DeskPets 🐶 🐿️

Desktop pets for Windows. Directly and explicitly inspired by 
[**vscode-pets**](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets)
by [**tonybaloney**](https://github.com/tonybaloney). 
This project adopts the same core idea, small pixel creatures living on your workspace.

## Installation (Windows only)

### Option 1 — Python 

```bash
pip install deskpets
```

And to run, in CMD.exe (according to have python in your PATH):

```bash
deskpets
```

### Option 2 — Executable

Download the `DeskPets.zip` from the [**Release**](https://github.com/Jumitti/DeskPets/releases) section, extract it, and run `DeskPets.exe`.

## Usage

Launching the application spawns one or more pets in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

Current behavior:

* Unlimited number of pets
* Some species support multiple color variations
* Per-species size control
* Position automatically adapts to the taskbar
* Simple interaction: some pets sit when the cursor gets close
