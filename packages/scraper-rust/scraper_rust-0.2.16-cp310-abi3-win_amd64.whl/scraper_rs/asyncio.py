"""Asyncio wrappers for scraper_rs functions.

This module provides async versions of the main scraper_rs functions,
allowing them to be used in asyncio applications without blocking the event loop.

Note: The Document class cannot be passed between threads due to PyO3 limitations,
so parse() executes in the current thread but yields control to the event loop.
The select() and xpath() functions can run in a thread pool since they return
only Element objects which are thread-safe.
