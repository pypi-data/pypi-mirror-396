_A unified, batteries-included client for embedding APIs that actually works._

</div>

**The world of embedding API clients is broken.**

- Everyone defaults to OpenAI's client for embeddings, even though it wasn't designed for that purpose
- Provider-specific libraries (VoyageAI, Cohere, etc.) are inconsistent, poorly maintained, or outright broken
- Universal clients like LiteLLM and any-llm-sdk don't focus on embeddings at all—they rely on native client libraries, inheriting all their problems
- Every provider has different capabilities—some support dimension changes, others don't—with no standardized way to discover what's available
- Most clients lack basic features like retry logic, proper error handling, and usage tracking
- There's no single source of truth for model metadata, pricing, or capabilities

**Catsu fixes this.** It's a lightweight, unified client built specifically for embeddings with:

🎯 A clean, consistent API across all providers </br>
🔄 Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff </br>
💰 Automatic usage and cost tracking </br>
📚 Rich model metadata and capability discovery </br>
⚠️ Proper error handling and type hints </br>
⚡ First-class support for both sync and async

## 📦 Install

Install with uv (recommended):
```bash
uv pip install catsu
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install catsu
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started in seconds! Just import catsu, create a client, and start embedding:

```python
import catsu

# Initialize the client
client = catsu.Client()

# Generate embeddings (auto-detects provider from model name)
response = client.embed(
    model="voyage-3",
    input="Hello, embeddings!"
)

# Access your results
print(f"Dimensions: {response.dimensions}")
print(f"Tokens used: {response.usage.tokens}")
print(f"Cost: ${response.usage.cost:.6f}")
print(f"Embedding: {response.embeddings[0][:5]}...")  # First 5 dims
```

That's it! No configuration needed—catsu picks up your API keys from environment variables automatically (`VOYAGE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).

**Want more control?** Specify the provider explicitly:
```python
# Method 1: Separate parameters
response = client.embed(provider="voyageai", model="voyage-3", input="Hello!")

# Method 2: Provider prefix
response = client.embed(model="voyageai:voyage-3", input="Hello!")
```

**Need async?** Just use `aembed`:
```python
response = await client.aembed(model="voyage-3", input="Hello, async world!")
```
