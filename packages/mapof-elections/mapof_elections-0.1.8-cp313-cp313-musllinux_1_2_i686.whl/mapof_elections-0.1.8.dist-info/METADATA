# Mapof-elections
This pacakge is a plugin for [Mapof](https://pypi.org/project/mapof/) extending
it with capabilities of drawing maps of various election intances.

For the most recent version of Mapof, visit its [git
repo](https://pypi.org/project/mapof/).

> [!WARNING]
> This library contains C++ extensions. Installing it without
> any package manager that uses the PyPi repository requires compiling the C++
> extension from sources. It might be a bit cumbersome and is far beyond the
> scope of this small manual.
 
# Installation
For a simple installation, type
`pip install mapof-elections`
in the console.

For more complicated variants of installation, refer to the [readme of
