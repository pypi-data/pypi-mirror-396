# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# See:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# NOTE: Python dependency updates are currently disabled because this project uses uv
# for package management (see ADR-009), and Dependabot does not yet support the uv
# ecosystem. When Dependabot adds uv support, Python dependencies can be re-enabled.
# See: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10478
#
# For manual Python dependency updates, use: uv lock --upgrade
