Take a deep breath. Ask yourself, what are you building and why are you building it?

Is it something that seems interesting or useful or fun?

Or is the point to try to dupe someone out of their money?

If it's the latter, then fuck off.

Otherwise do whatever you find interesting and rewarding with this software.
