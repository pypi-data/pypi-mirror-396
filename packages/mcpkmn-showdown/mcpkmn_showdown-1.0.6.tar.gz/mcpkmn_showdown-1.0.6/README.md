A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that provides Pokemon Showdown data to LLMs. Enables AI assistants like Claude to look up Pokemon stats, moves, abilities, items, and type matchups during conversations.

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to securely access external tools and data sources. This server exposes Pokemon game data as MCP tools that Claude and other compatible LLMs can call.

## Features

- **Pokemon Lookup** - Stats, types, abilities for any Pokemon
- **Move Database** - Power, accuracy, effects, priority, descriptions
- **Ability Info** - Full descriptions of what abilities do in battle
- **Item Effects** - Held item descriptions and battle effects
- **Type Calculator** - Calculate type effectiveness multipliers
- **Priority Moves** - Search for moves with priority (Quick Attack, etc.)
- **Ability Search** - Find all Pokemon with a specific ability
- **Dangerous Abilities** - List battle-critical abilities (immunities, etc.)
