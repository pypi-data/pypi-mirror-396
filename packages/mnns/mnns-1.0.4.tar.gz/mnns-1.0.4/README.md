MemNNetSim: Memristive Nanowire Network Simulator. A proof-of-concept Python package for modelling and analyzing memristive random nanowire networks (NWNs). This package, developed by Marcus Kasdorf, was initiated from a summer research project in 2021 and continued to be developed under the supervision of Dr. Claudia Gomes da Rocha at the University of Calgary.

# Installation

MemNNetSim has been tested on Python 3.10 to 3.13. It is recommended to install
MemNNetSim in a virtual environment such as with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) 
or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html)/[mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

For installing locally, a pip version of [21.1](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/news/#v21-1) 
or greater is required.

## Installation from PyPI

Install the latest release of MemNNetSim from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/p/mnns) 
using pip:
```bash
pip install mnns
```

## Installation for development

Download or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcus-k/MemNNetSim/):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcus-k/MemNNetSim.git
cd ./MemNNetSim
```

Then install the package in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) 
using pip:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

To install for editing the documentation, add the `[docs]` [optional dependencies](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies):
```bash
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

## Uninstallation

Uninstall MemNNetSim using pip:
```bash
pip uninstall mnns
```

# Usage

Nanowire network objects are simply [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) graphs with various attributes stored in the graph, edges, and nodes.

```python
>>> import mnns
>>> NWN = mnns.create_NWN(seed=123)
>>> NWN
                Type: JDA
               Wires: 750
          Electrodes: 0
Inner-wire junctions: None
      Wire junctions: 3238
              Length: 50.00 um (7.143 l0)
               Width: 50.00 um (7.143 l0)
        Wire Density: 0.3000 um^-2 (14.70 l0^-2)
>>> mnns.plot_NWN(NWN)
(<Figure size 800x600 with 1 Axes>, <AxesSubplot:>)
```
