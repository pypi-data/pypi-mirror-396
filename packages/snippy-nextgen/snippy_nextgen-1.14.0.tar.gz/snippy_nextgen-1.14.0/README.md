## Installation

`snippy` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/snippy-nextgen/) and can be installed using `pip` (without external dependencies):
```console
pip install snippy-nextgen
```

The complete snippy-ng environment (including all dependencies) can be installed using the `snippy-ng` installer script. This script will install the latest version of `snippy-ng` and all its dependencies.

```console
curl -sSL https://cpg.org.au/snippy-ng/install.sh | bash -s -- --force
```

## Development

To set up a development environment, clone the repository and install `pixi` and `hatch`. Pixi is used to manage external dependencies, and Hatch is used to manage the Python package development.

```console
git clone git@github.com:centre-pathogen-genomics/snippy-ng.git && cd snippy-ng
# install pixi if not already installed
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
# install hatch if not already installed
pixi global add hatch
```

Activate the pixi environment and launch a hatch shell. THis will install all dependencies and set up the development environment.

```console
pixi shell
hatch shell
```

```console
snippy-ng --help
```
