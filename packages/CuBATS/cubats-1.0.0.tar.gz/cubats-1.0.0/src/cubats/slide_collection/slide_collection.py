    """Initializes a slide collection, stores slide info and performs slide processing.

    `SlideCollection` is a class that initializes a collection of slides, stores relevant processing information,
    and allows the execution of separate processing steps. Previously processed data can be reloaded.

    Attributes:

            creation inside the `dest_dir`. Inside the data directory summaries of quantification results, dual antigen
            expression results and triplet antigen expression results are stored as .CSV file.
            The data_dir also contains the `pickle_dir`.

        pickle_dir (str): Path to pickle directory, a subdirectory of `data_dir`. Inside the pickle directory pickled
            copies of the slide_collection, quantification results and antigen analysis are stored which will be
            automatically reloaded if a slide collection is (re-)initialized with the same output_dir.

        tiles_dir (str): Path to tiles directory, a subdirectory of `dest_dir`. Inside the tiles directory the tile
            directories for each slide are stored.

        colocalization_dir (str): Path to colocalization directory, a subdirectory of `dest_dir`. Inside the
            colocalization directory results of dual and triplet overlap analyses are stored.

        reconstruct_dir (str): Path to reconstruct directory, a subdirectory of `dest_dir`. Inside the reconstruct
            directory reconstructed slides are stored.

            - Tiles (DeepZoomGenerator): DeepZoom tiles of the slide.
            - Level Count (int): Number of Deep Zoom levels in the image.

        mask (Slide): Mask slide of the collection. Is set during initialization.

        mask_coordinates (list): List containing the tile coordinates for tiles that are covered by the mask
            Coordinates are tuples (column, row).

        Analyzes antigen co-expressions for each of tiles of the given triplet of slides using Multiprocessing based on
        the antigen-specific thresholds of each slide. Results from each of the tiles are summarized, stored in
        `triplet_antigen_expressions` and saved as CSV in `data_dir` as well as PICKLE in `pickle_dir`. For more
        detailed explanation of the co-expression results see `SlideCollection.triplet_antigen_expressions`.

            slide1 (Slide): Slide Object for slide 1.

            slide2 (Slide): Slide Object for slide 2.

            slide3 (Slide): Slide Object for slide 3.

            save_img (bool):  Boolean determining if tiles shall be saved during processing. Necessary if slide shall be
                reconstructed later on. However, storing images will require additional storage. Defaults to False.

            masking_mode (str): Determines the mode for mask application that was used for quantification.

                - `tile-level` (default): Applies the mask coarsly - tiles overlapping the mask are fully included.
                   Recommended when registration quality is lower (e.g. high median rTRE).

                - `pixel-level`: Applies the mask precisely at pixel level - only masked pixels are included.
                   Offers finer co-expression evaluation, but is more sensitive to registration errors.
