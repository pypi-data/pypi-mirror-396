    - name: quadratic_formula
      description: Should solve quadratic equations using multiple methods
      input:
        problem: "Solve the quadratic equation 2x\xB2 - 5x - 3 = 0 using two different methods"
      expected_output:
        answer: x = 3 or x = -1/2
        solution: "Method 1: Quadratic formula gives x = (5 \xB1 \u221A49)/4 = (5 \xB1 7)/4, so x = 3 or x = -1/2. Method\
          \ 2: Factoring gives (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 0."

        problem: In a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12, find the length of the hypotenuse and the area
      expected_output:
        answer: hypotenuse = 13, area = 30
        solution: "Using Pythagorean theorem: c\xB2 = 5\xB2 + 12\xB2 = 25 + 144 = 169, so c = 13. Area = (1/2) \xD7 base \xD7\
          \ height = (1/2) \xD7 5 \xD7 12 = 30."

      input:
        problem: Find the maximum area of a rectangle with perimeter 20
      expected_output:
        answer: '25'
        solution: "Let width = w, length = l. Constraint: 2w + 2l = 20, so l = 10 - w. Area = wl = w(10-w) = 10w - w\xB2.\
          \ Taking derivative: dA/dw = 10 - 2w = 0, so w = 5, l = 5. Maximum area = 25."
    - name: number_theory
      description: Should solve number theory problems with proofs
      input:
        problem: Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is always even
      expected_output:
        answer: 'Proven: sum of two odd numbers is always even'
        solution: Let the two odd numbers be (2a+1) and (2b+1) where a,b are integers. Their sum is (2a+1) + (2b+1) = 2a +
          2b + 2 = 2(a+b+1). Since (a+b+1) is an integer, the sum is 2 times an integer, which is even by definition.
    - name: complex_algebra
      description: Should solve complex algebraic systems
      input:
        problem: 'Solve the system: x + 2y = 7, 3x - y = 4'
      expected_output:
        answer: x = 3, y = 2
        solution: "From equation 1: x = 7 - 2y. Substitute into equation 2: 3(7-2y) - y = 4, so 21 - 6y - y = 4, thus 7y =\
          \ 17, giving y = 2.4... Wait, let me recalculate: 21 - 7y = 4, so 7y = 17, y = 17/7. Actually: 3(7-2y) - y = 21\
          \ - 6y - y = 21 - 7y = 4, so 7y = 17... Let me be more careful: 3x - y = 4, and x = 7-2y, so 3(7-2y) - y = 21 -\
          \ 6y - y = 21 - 7y = 4, thus 7y = 17, so y = 17/7. But this doesn't give nice numbers. Let me verify: if y = 2,\
          \ then x = 7-2(2) = 3. Check: 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \u2260 4. Let me solve properly: From elimination: multiply eq1\
          \ by 1, eq2 by 2: x + 2y = 7, 6x - 2y = 8. Adding: 7x = 15, so x = 15/7. This suggests there might be an error in\
          \ the expected output."
