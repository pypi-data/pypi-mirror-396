        solution: "Let width = w and length = l. Constraint: 2w + 2l = 20, so l = 10 - w. Area A = w \xD7 l = w(10 - w) =\
          \ 10w - w\xB2. To find maximum: dA/dw = 10 - 2w = 0, so w = 5. When w = 5, l = 10 - 5 = 5. Maximum area = 5 \xD7\

      expected_output:
        answer: x = 3, y = 2
        solution: "From the first equation: x = 7 - 2y. Substituting into the second equation: 3(7 - 2y) - y = 4. Expanding:\
          \ 21 - 6y - y = 4, so 21 - 7y = 4, giving 7y = 17, thus y = 17/7. Wait, let me recalculate: 3(7-2y) - y = 21 - 6y\
          \ - y = 21 - 7y = 4, so 7y = 17. This gives y = 17/7 \u2248 2.43, but the expected answer is y = 2. Let me verify\
          \ the expected answer: if x = 3, y = 2, then eq1: 3 + 2(2) = 3 + 4 = 7 \u2713, eq2: 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \u2260\
          \ 4. The expected answer seems incorrect."
