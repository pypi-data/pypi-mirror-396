    - name: quadratic_equation
      description: Should solve quadratic equations
      input:
        problem: "Solve 2x\xB2 - 5x - 3 = 0"
      expected_output:
        answer: x = 3 or x = -1/2
        solution: "Using quadratic formula: x = (5 \xB1 \u221A(25 + 24))/4 = (5 \xB1 7)/4"
    - name: right_triangle
      description: Should solve right triangle problems
      input:
        problem: Find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 5 and 12
      expected_output:
        answer: '13'
        solution: "Using Pythagorean theorem: c\xB2 = 5\xB2 + 12\xB2 = 25 + 144 = 169, so c = 13"
    - name: rectangle_optimization
      description: Should solve optimization problems
      input:
        problem: Find the maximum area of a rectangle with perimeter 20
      expected_output:
        answer: '25'
        solution: "Square maximizes area. Side length = 20/4 = 5. Area = 5\xB2 = 25"
