      description: When supporting someone with anxiety, the agent should provide evidence-based coping strategies and professional

      input:
        concern_description: Client reports constant worry about work performance, difficulty sleeping, physical symptoms
          like rapid heartbeat and sweating before meetings. Symptoms worsening over past 3 months.
        current_mood: 28 years old

        guidance: '**Anxiety Assessment & Support Plan**


          **Step 1: Symptom Pattern Recognition**

          - Cognitive symptoms: Constant worry, work performance fears

          - Physical symptoms: Rapid heartbeat, sweating, sleep disruption

          - Behavioral impact: Affecting work and daily functioning

          - Timeline: 3-month progression suggests intervention needed


          **Step 2: Anxiety Type Identification**

          - Likely performance anxiety with generalized components

          - Physical symptoms indicate fight-or-flight activation

          - Sleep disruption compounds anxiety cycle

          - Work-related triggers suggest situational factors


          **Step 3: Severity Assessment**

          - Functional impairment present (work performance concerns)

          - Multiple symptom domains affected

          - Progressive worsening indicates need for structured support'
        resources: '**Comprehensive Anxiety Management Plan**


          **Immediate Coping Strategies:**

          1. Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 technique) before meetings

          2. Progressive muscle relaxation for physical symptoms

          3. Sleep hygiene improvement (consistent schedule, no screens 1 hour before bed)

          4. Grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 sensory method)


          **Cognitive Strategies:**

          - Challenge catastrophic thinking patterns

          - Develop realistic self-talk about work performance

          - Practice mindfulness meditation (10 minutes daily)

          - Journal worries to externalize and examine them


          **Lifestyle Modifications:**

          - Regular exercise (30 minutes, 3x/week minimum)

          - Limit caffeine intake, especially before meetings

          - Structured work breaks and boundaries

          - Social support activation


          **Professional Support Recommendation:**

          Given 3-month progression and functional impairment, recommend consultation with licensed therapist specializing
          in anxiety disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has strong evidence base for performance anxiety.'
