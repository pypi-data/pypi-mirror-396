    - name: medication_interaction_query
      description: Should provide comprehensive medication interaction analysis
      input:
        medical_query: What are the interactions between warfarin and ibuprofen?
        patient_context: Adult patient on anticoagulation therapy
      expected_output:
        clinical_analysis: Warfarin and ibuprofen have a significant drug interaction. Ibuprofen can increase bleeding risk
          by affecting platelet function and potentially displacing warfarin from protein binding sites.
        risk_factors: Increased bleeding risk, potential for dangerous INR elevation, gastrointestinal bleeding risk
        recommendations: Consult prescribing physician before combining these medications. Alternative pain management may
          be recommended.
        patient_education: These medications can interact to increase bleeding risk. Your doctor needs to monitor you closely
          if both are necessary.
        medical_disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only. Always consult your healthcare provider before
          making medication changes.
    - name: symptom_analysis_chest_pain
      description: Should analyze chest pain symptoms systematically
      input:
        medical_query: 35-year-old reports sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, started after coughing fit
        patient_context: Otherwise healthy adult, no cardiac risk factors
      expected_output:
        clinical_analysis: Sharp chest pain worsening with inspiration (pleuritic pain) following cough suggests possible
          musculoskeletal strain, costochondritis, or pleuritis.
        risk_factors: 'Must rule out serious causes: pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, cardiac causes despite low risk'
        recommendations: Requires immediate medical evaluation to rule out serious causes. Chest pain should always be evaluated
          promptly.
        patient_education: Chest pain can have many causes, from muscle strain to serious conditions. Medical evaluation is
          essential for proper diagnosis.
        medical_disclaimer: Chest pain requires immediate medical attention. This analysis does not replace emergency medical
          care.
    - name: preventive_care_guidance
      description: Should provide evidence-based preventive care information
      input:
        medical_query: What preventive screenings are recommended for a 45-year-old woman?
        patient_context: Average risk, no family history of major diseases
      expected_output:
        clinical_analysis: 'Age 45 preventive care typically includes: mammography screening, cervical cancer screening, cardiovascular
          risk assessment, diabetes screening, and age-appropriate immunizations.'
        risk_factors: Individual risk factors may modify screening recommendations (family history, personal risk factors)
        recommendations: Discuss personalized screening schedule with primary care provider based on individual risk factors
          and preferences.
        patient_education: Preventive screenings help detect diseases early when treatment is most effective. Your doctor
          will create a personalized plan.
        medical_disclaimer: Screening recommendations vary by individual risk factors. Consult your healthcare provider for
          personalized guidance.
