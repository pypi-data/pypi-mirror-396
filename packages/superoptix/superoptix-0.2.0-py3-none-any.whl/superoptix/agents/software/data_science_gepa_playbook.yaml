    scenarios:
    - name: customer_churn_prediction
      description: Should provide comprehensive approach for customer churn prediction
      input:
        problem_description: Predict customer churn for a SaaS company with 50,000 customers. Need to identify customers at
          risk of canceling their subscription in the next 30 days.
        data_context: 'Features include: usage metrics, support tickets, payment history, account age, plan type. Historical
          churn rate is 15% annually.'
      expected_output:
        statistical_analysis: 15% annual churn rate suggests significant retention challenge. Need to analyze feature correlations
          and identify churn patterns.
        methodology: Use supervised learning with temporal validation. Split data chronologically to prevent data leakage.
          Consider class imbalance (85% retain vs 15% churn).
        model_recommendations: Start with logistic regression for interpretability, then try Random Forest and XGBoost. Consider
          ensemble methods for improved performance.
        evaluation_strategy: Use precision-recall curves (imbalanced classes), time-based cross-validation, and business metrics
          like customer lifetime value impact.
        business_insights: Focus on early warning signals and actionable interventions. Prioritize high-value customers and
          cost-effective retention strategies.
    - name: sales_forecasting
      description: Should provide robust sales forecasting methodology
      input:
        problem_description: Forecast monthly sales for the next 6 months for an e-commerce business with seasonal patterns
          and promotional effects.
        data_context: 3 years of historical sales data, promotional calendar, economic indicators, weather data. Strong seasonality
          with Q4 peaks.
      expected_output:
        statistical_analysis: Strong seasonal patterns with Q4 spikes. Need to decompose trend, seasonality, and promotional
          effects. Check for stationarity.
        methodology: Time series analysis with seasonal decomposition. Consider SARIMA, Prophet, or neural time series models.
          Include external regressors for promotions.
        model_recommendations: Prophet for interpretable seasonality handling, LSTM for complex patterns, ensemble of multiple
          approaches for robustness.
        evaluation_strategy: Use time series cross-validation, MAPE, WMAPE metrics. Validate on holdout periods including
          seasonal transitions.
        business_insights: Provide confidence intervals for forecasts. Highlight key drivers and scenario planning for promotional
          strategies.
    - name: fraud_detection_system
      description: Should design comprehensive fraud detection approach
      input:
        problem_description: Build real-time fraud detection system for credit card transactions. Need to minimize false positives
          while catching fraudulent transactions.
        data_context: Transaction data including amount, merchant, location, time, customer behavior patterns. Fraud rate
          is approximately 0.1%.
      expected_output:
        statistical_analysis: Extremely imbalanced dataset (99.9% legitimate vs 0.1% fraud). Need sophisticated sampling and
          evaluation strategies.
        methodology: Use anomaly detection combined with supervised learning. Implement real-time scoring with feedback loops
          for model updates.
        model_recommendations: Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, XGBoost with SMOTE for imbalanced learning, ensemble
          with multiple algorithms.
        evaluation_strategy: Focus on precision-recall trade-off, use AUC-PR instead of AUC-ROC. Implement A/B testing for
          business impact measurement.
        business_insights: Balance fraud prevention with customer experience. Implement tiered response system and continuous
          model monitoring.
