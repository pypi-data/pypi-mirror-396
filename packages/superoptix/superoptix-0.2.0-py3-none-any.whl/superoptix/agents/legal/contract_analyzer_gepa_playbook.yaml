    - name: employment_contract_analysis
      description: Should analyze employment contract terms and risks
      input:
        contract_text: Employee agrees to work exclusively for Company for 2 years. Employee cannot work for competitors for
          24 months after termination. Company may terminate at will with 30 days notice. Employee must relocate if requested.
        contract_type: employment
      expected_output:
        key_terms: 2-year exclusive employment, 24-month non-compete, at-will termination with 30-day notice, mandatory relocation
          clause
        risk_analysis: 'High risk: Broad non-compete may be unenforceable; Medium risk: Mandatory relocation without compensation
          may be problematic'
        compliance_issues: Non-compete clause may violate state restrictions; Relocation clause may need geographic/compensation
          limits
        negotiation_recommendations: Narrow non-compete scope, add mutual termination notice, negotiate relocation compensation
        missing_clauses: Severability clause, dispute resolution mechanism, intellectual property assignment details
    - name: vendor_service_agreement
      description: Should analyze vendor service agreement risks
      input:
        contract_text: Vendor provides software services for $10,000/month. No service level guarantees. Vendor owns all intellectual
          property. Client liable for all damages. Contract automatically renews annually.
        contract_type: vendor_service
      expected_output:
        key_terms: $10,000/month service fee, no SLA guarantees, vendor IP ownership, client damage liability, auto-renewal
        risk_analysis: 'Critical risk: Unlimited client liability; High risk: No service guarantees; Medium risk: Vendor IP
          ownership'
        compliance_issues: Unlimited liability may violate corporate governance; Auto-renewal may need opt-out provisions
        negotiation_recommendations: Cap liability exposure, add SLA requirements, negotiate IP rights, modify auto-renewal
          terms
        missing_clauses: Force majeure, data privacy/security provisions, termination procedures, limitation of liability
    - name: nda_confidentiality_agreement
      description: Should analyze confidentiality and NDA terms
      input:
        contract_text: Parties agree to keep all information confidential indefinitely. Breaching party pays $100,000 penalty
          plus legal fees. Non-disclosure covers all communications and observations.
        contract_type: nda
      expected_output:
        key_terms: Indefinite confidentiality period, $100,000 penalty plus legal fees, broad information scope
        risk_analysis: 'Medium risk: Indefinite term may be excessive; Low risk: Penalty amount seems reasonable for significant
          breaches'
        compliance_issues: Indefinite confidentiality may be legally challenging to enforce
        negotiation_recommendations: Consider time limits on confidentiality (5-7 years), clarify information scope exceptions
        missing_clauses: Standard exceptions (publicly known, independently developed), return of materials, jurisdictional
          provisions
