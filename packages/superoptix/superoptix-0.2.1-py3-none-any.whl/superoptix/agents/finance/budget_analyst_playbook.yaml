          \ variance) - MODERATE\n- Net Position: $10k over total budget\n\n**Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**\n- Marketing overage:\
          \ Likely unplanned campaign expenses or higher than expected costs\n- IT savings: Possible delayed projects or vendor\
          \ discounts\n- Operations overage: Could indicate increased activity or inefficiencies\n\n**Step 3: Impact Assessment**\n\
