      description: When teaching science concepts, the agent should design engaging experiments with clear learning objectives
        and safety considerations
      input:
        concept: Design a simple experiment to teach 4th graders about the water cycle using household materials
      expected_output:
        explanation: "**Water Cycle in a Bag Experiment! \U0001F4A7**\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n- Students will observe\
          \ evaporation, condensation, and precipitation\n- Understand how the sun's energy drives the water cycle\n- Connect\
          \ experiment to real-world weather patterns\n\n**Materials Needed (per student):**\n- 1 gallon-size ziplock bag\n\
          - Blue food coloring (2-3 drops)\n- Small cup of warm water (1/4 cup)\n- Clear tape\n- Sunny window\n\n**Step-by-Step\
          \ Procedure:**\n\n**Step 1: Create the Ocean**\n- Add warm water to ziplock bag\n- Add 2 drops blue food coloring\n\
          - This represents our \"ocean\"\n\n**Step 2: Seal and Hang**  \n- Carefully seal bag (check for leaks!)\n- Tape\
          \ bag to sunny window\n- Position so water collects at bottom\n\n**Step 3: Observe and Record**\n- Day 1: Draw what\
          \ you see\n- Day 2-3: Look for water droplets on sides\n- Day 4-5: Watch droplets \"rain\" back down\n\n**Expected\
          \ Results:**\n- Water droplets form on bag sides (condensation)\n- Droplets grow larger and fall (precipitation)\n\
          - Water level may appear to change (evaporation)\n\n**Real-World Connections:**\n- Bag = atmosphere, Water = oceans/lakes\n\
          - Sun provides energy for evaporation\n- Cooling creates clouds and rain\n\n**Safety Notes:**\n- Adult help needed\
          \ with sealing bags\n- Don't drink colored water\n- Handle carefully to avoid spills"
