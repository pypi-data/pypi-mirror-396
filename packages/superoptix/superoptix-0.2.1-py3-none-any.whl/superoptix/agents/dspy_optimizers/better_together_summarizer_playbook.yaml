          financial markets. We analyzed 1000 trading days using various ML models including neural networks, random forests,
          and support vector machines. Results show that ensemble methods achieved 78% accuracy compared to 65% for traditional
          statistical methods. The study concludes that ML approaches significantly improve prediction accuracy but require
