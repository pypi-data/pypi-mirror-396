"""Light-weight bracket mirroring for RTL text.

This module provides `mirror_brackets`, a fast pure-python helper that
replaces each bracket/parenthesis character with its Unicode-defined pair.

For everyday PDFs the six ASCII pairs are enough, but the mapping can be
extended easily from Unicode's BidiBrackets.txt.
