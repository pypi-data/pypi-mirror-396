description = """
midir is a Python library designed to handle relative module dependencies by 
resolving directory paths in an intelligent and system-agnostic way. This 
library can be used to introspect the file structure of your project and 
manipulate Python's sys.path, allowing for dynamic module imports based on 
directory hierarchy. It is especially helpful for larger projects where file 
structure can become complex and static imports cumbersome to manage.
