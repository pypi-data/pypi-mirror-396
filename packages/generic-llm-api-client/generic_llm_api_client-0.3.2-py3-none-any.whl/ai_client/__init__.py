"""
Unified AI client package for multiple providers.

This package provides a standardized interface for interacting with various AI models through
their respective APIs, with separate implementation files for each provider.

Key features:
- Abstract base client defining the common interface for all AI providers
- Provider-specific implementations for OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Mistral, Cohere, DeepSeek, and Qwen
- Support for both text-only and multimodal (text + images) content
- Consistent LLMResponse format with detailed usage tracking
- Factory method to create appropriate client based on provider
- Built-in retry logic and rate limiting
- Optional async support for parallel processing

Technical implementation details:
- OpenAI: Uses the chat completions API with multimodal support and structured output
- Google Gemini: Uses the GenerativeModel class with image support
- Anthropic Claude: Uses the messages API with tool-based structured output
- Mistral: Uses the chat completion API with multimodal support
- Cohere: Uses the chat API (ClientV2) with vision model support for multimodal content
- DeepSeek: OpenAI-compatible API with custom base URL
- Qwen: OpenAI-compatible API with custom base URL
- OpenRouter/sciCORE: Use OpenAI client with custom base URLs
