# FreeStylo - an easy-to-use stylistic device detection tool for stylometry

An easy-to-use package for detecting stylistic devices in text. This package is designed to be used in stylometry, the study of linguistic style.

For those proficient in python, this package provides a collection of approaches to detect stylistic devices in text. For those less proficient in python, this package provides a simple interface to detect stylistic devices in text with simple commands and user-friendly configuration.

# Installation

This package needs python 3.12 to run. It is recommended to create
a virtual environment for the package.
The package is available on PyPi and can be installed using pip.

```
pip install freestylo
```

# Configuration

The package can be configured using the configuration file under `~/.config/freestylo/config.json`. This file will be created when the tool is first run or the library needs information from the config file.
Currently only the model download location can be configured.
The model path can also be overridden by setting the environment variable `FREESTYLO_MODEL_PATH`.

The default configuration is:
```json
{
    "model_path": "~/.freestylo/models/"
}
```

# Usage Examples

## Standalone Tool

After installation, you can run the following command to test that the tool is installed correctly. 

If you've cloned the git repository, run this command in the root of the repository. If you've used pip to install the package, first you'll need to download the input and configuration files.

<details>

<summary>Download test input and example configuration</summary>

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvjena/freestylo/refs/heads/main/example_config.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvjena/freestylo/refs/heads/main/test/documents/chiasmustext.txt
mkdir -p test/documents && mv chiasmustext.txt test/documents/
```
</details>

```bash
freestylo --input test/documents/chiasmustext.txt \
    --output ./output.json \
    --config example_config.json
```
The example_config.json and chiasmustext.txt are contained in this repository. Either download them manually or just clone the repository and run the command from the project root folder.

This creates the file `output.json` in the root of the repository, which contains the detected stylistic devices in the text file `test/documents/chiasmustext.txt`.
Afterwards, run the following command to get an overview over the results:

```bash

freestylo --mode report --data output.json
```


The package can be used both as a library and as a stand-alone command-line tool.
Both from the library and from the command-line tool, the results can be saved in a JSON file.
This json file will contain the complete tokenized text.
When using the functions from the library, the result will be a python container with a similar structure to the JSON file.

To only download the models without running any annotation, use the following command:

```bash
freestylo --mode download_models
```

The standalone version can be configured using a simple JSON configuration file. The file should specify the language of the text and the stylistic devices to detect. The following is an example configuration file:

```json
{
    "language": "de",
    "annotations": {
        "chiasmus": {
            "window_size": 30,
            "allowlist": ["NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "ADV"],
            "denylist": [],
            "model": "/chiasmus_de.pkl"
        }
    }
}
```

The output for the standalone tool is structured as follows:

                'text': self.text,
                'tokens': self.tokens,
                'pos': self.pos,
                'lemmas': self.lemmas,
                'dep': self.dep,
                'token_offsets': self.token_offsets,
                'annotations': annotations

First, it contains a whole copy of the text in the `text` field.
It then contains the preprocessed lists of tokens, POS tags, lemmas, dependency labels and token offsets.
Finally, it contains an `annotations` field that contains the detected stylistic devices.
This field is a dictionary that contains one entry for each stylistic device detector that was applied to the text.
The exact information contained in the annotations depends on the stylistic device detector, but generally they contain the ids of the tokens that are part of the detected devices, meaning their index in the`tokens` list (and respectively in the `pos`, `lemmas`, etc. lists) as well as a score that indicates the likelihood of the detected device being a true positive.


## Library

The library comprises a collection of functions to detect the stylistic devices, as well as preprocessing based on spaCy.
Should you want to use different preprocessing or use the package with a different language than the supported ones, a TextObject can be created and filled with the needed manually computed contents.
The stylistic device detectors can then be applied to the TextObject.

The `tests` folder contains a test for every stylistic device detector.
These tests show how to use the different detectors and how to create a TextObject.
All classes and functions are documented by docstrings.

A typical example code would look like this:
```python
from freestylo import TextObject as to
from freestylo import TextPreprocessor as tp
from freestylo import ChiasmusAnnotation as ca
from freestylo import MetaphorAnnotation as ma

# first, create a TextObject from the raw text
text = to.TextObject(
        # put the path to your text file here
        textfile = "example_textfile.txt",
        language="en")

# create a TextPreprocessor object and process the text
# this does the tokenizing, lemmatizing, POS-tagging, etc.
preprocessor = tp.TextPreprocessor(language="en")
preprocessor.process_text(text)

# you can also use a different preprocessing of your choice
# without the TextPreprocessor object
# just fill the TextObject with the needed contents
# those could be provided e.g. by spaCy, nltk, cltk,
# or any other method of your choice

# many digital corpora are already tokenized and POS-tagged
# they may come in various formats, such as TEI XML, CoNLL, etc.
# if you have a text in those formats, you can fill the TextObject
# with the needed contents
# you can then fill the missing values in the TextObject
# with e.g. word vectors or other features created with a method of your choice.

# you can now add various annotations to the text object
# here, we add a chiasmus annotation
chiasmus = ca.ChiasmusAnnotation(
        text=text)
chiasmus.allowlist = ["NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "ADV"]
chiasmus.find_candidates()
chiasmus.load_classification_model("chiasmus_de.pkl")
chiasmus.score_candidates()

# here, we add a metaphor annotation
metaphor = ma.MetaphorAnnotation(
        text=text)
metaphor.find_candidates()
metaphor.load_model("metaphor_de.torch")
metaphor.score_candidates()

# finally, save the annotated text to a json file
text.serialize("annotated_text.json")
```

The file `test/test_external_source.py` shows an an example of using the library without the text preprocessor. Instead the TextObject is filled by hand with the needed contents.

Currently supported stylistic devices are:
- Alliteration
- Chiasmus
- Epiphora
- Metaphor
- Polysyndeton

Please find an overview of the detectors and their methods in the [documentation](docs/docs.md).

## Create your own detectors!


The package is designed to be easily extendable with your own stylistic device detectors.
The `src` folder contains example scripts that show how you can retrain the models for the existing chiasmus and metaphor detectors.
You can also create your own stylistic device detectors by referring to the existing ones.
Especially the Alliteration Detector provides a very simple example that can be used as a template for your own detectors.
If you create and want to contribute your own detecors, pull requests are very welcome!


# Participation
The package is free and open-source software and contributions are very welcome.
It is designed to be a living project that is constantly improved and extended.
