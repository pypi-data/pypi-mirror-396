class RustOperatorDelegate(ABC):
    """
    A RustOperatorDelegate is an interface to be implemented to build
    streaming platform operators in Python and wire them up to the
    Rust Streaming Adapter.

    This delegate runs in a Rust Arroyo strategy which delegates message
    processing to instances of this class following this process:
    1. The rust strategy receives a message via `submit`
    2. The rust strategy forwards the message to the delegate (the instance
       of this class), which takes it over.
    3. The StreamingProcessor calls `poll` on the Rust Arroyo strategy.
    4. The rust strategy calls poll on the delegate that may or may
       not return processed messages.
    5. If the delegate returns messages, the Rust strategy forwards them
       to the Arroyo next step.

    This class does not provides exactly the same Arroyo strategy
    interface. Instead it provides something easier to manage in Rust.

    - It is not the responsibility of the methods of this class to forward
      messages to the following steps in the pipeline. `poll` and `flush`
      return messages to the Rust code which then forwards them to the
      next strategy. This allows this delegate not to have access to the
      next step which is in Rust.

    - `submit` accepts work, while `poll` performs the processing on the
      messages accepted by `submit`. This interface allows implementations
      to support both 1:0..1, 1:n, n:0..1 processing strategies. It is also
      inherently asynchronous as only poll can return messages.

        processing and returns the result.

        The rust code interprets MessageRejected as backpressure and
        InvalidMessage as a message that cannot be processed to be
        sent to DLQ.

        The `committable` parameters contains the offsets represented by
        the message. It is up to the implementation of this class to

    This delegate wraps an existing Python Arroyo strategy so that it can be

    Objects of this class are provided a strategy to wrap, a Callable to
    transform input messages if a transformation is needed and an
    `OutputRetriever` to collect the results from the inner strategy and
    make them available to rust.

    The message flow looks like this:
    1. The Rust Arroyo Strategy receives a streaming message to process.
    2. The Rust Strategy hands it to this class via the `submit` method.
    3. The `submit` method transforms the input message into a Python
       Arroyo message for the wrapped strategy via the `in_transformer`.

      cannot be exposed to python.
    - The Python Strategy cannot return results directly to Rust.
      It can only pass them to the next step (like all Arroyo strategies).
      So it needs a next step that can provide the results to Rust.
    - The Arroyo strategy is an Arroyo strategy, so it needs to be
      fed with Arroyo messages, thus the adaptation logic from the
      new Streaming platform message that the Rust code deals with.
