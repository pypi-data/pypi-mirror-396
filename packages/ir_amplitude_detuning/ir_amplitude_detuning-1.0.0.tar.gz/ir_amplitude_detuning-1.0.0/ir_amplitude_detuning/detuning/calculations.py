    the contents of which as described in more detail in the Chapter 7.2.2 of [DillyThesis2024]_ ,
    in particular Eq. (7.4).
    In addition, :class:`~ir_amplitude_detuning.detuning.measurements.Constraints`
    can be added to the correction equation system,
    which are respected when using the :class:`cvxpy.Problem` solver (method ``cvxpy``).

    In fact, this function always calculates the values with the :class:`convex solver<cvxpy.Problem>` (``cvxpy``),
    as well as with the :func:`pseudo-inverse <numpy.linalg.pinv>` method (``numpy``),
    but only returns the results of the method specified in `method`.
    The ``cvxpy`` method has the advantage that the constraints are respected,
    the ``numpy`` method has the advantage that the uncertainties are propagated.
    The function returns a series of correctors and their settings in KNL values, with uncertainties if available.

    In this function everything contributing to the left hand side of the equation system (i.e. the matrix *M*) is named ``m_*``,
    while everything that contributes to the right hand side (i.e. the detuning values *V*, or similarly the constraint values)
    is named ``v_*``.

    .. warning::
       The calculated magnet strength assumes that the magnet circuit is implemented with a positive sign,
       giving a positive field gradient, in beam 1 and - when the field is anti-symmetric - a negative sign in beam 4
       and does not have any coefficients.

    Args:
        target (Target): A Target object defining the target detuning and constraints.
        method (Method): The results of which method used to solve the equation system to be returned.

    Returns:
        pd.Series[float]: A Series of circuit names and their settings in KNL values.
