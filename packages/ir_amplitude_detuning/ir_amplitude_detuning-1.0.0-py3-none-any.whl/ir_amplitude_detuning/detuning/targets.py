Correction Targets
------------------

Classes used to define correction targets.
Each Target will be used to calcualate the correction,
i.e. transformed into a single detuning equation system.

To accurately correct for different detuning contributions from the errors and
crossing in each IP (or combination of IPs), each Target contains a list of
TargetData, which defines the measured detuning and constraints for each machine configuration.
These are used to build the rows of the equation system, with a single TargetData
defining multiple rows, depending on the amount of beams and detuning components given.

This allows for a combined "local", targeting the detunning stemming from a single IP,
and "global", correcting for the combined detuning in the machine, correction if needed.
