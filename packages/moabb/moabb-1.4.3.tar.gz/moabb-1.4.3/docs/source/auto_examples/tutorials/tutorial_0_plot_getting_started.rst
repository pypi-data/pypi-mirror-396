============================
Tutorial 0: Getting Started
============================

This tutorial takes you through a basic working example of how to use this
codebase, including all the different components, up to the results
generation. If you'd like to know about the statistics and plotting, see the
next tutorial.

Introduction
--------------------
To use the codebase you need an evaluation and a paradigm, some algorithms,
and a list of datasets to run it all on. You can find those in the following
submodules; detailed tutorials are given for each of them.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-31

.. code-block:: Python


    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis as LDA
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.svm import SVC


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-34

If you would like to specify the logging level when it is running, you can
use the standard python logging commands through the top-level moabb module

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-41

.. code-block:: Python

    import moabb
    from moabb.datasets import BNCI2014_001, utils
    from moabb.evaluations import CrossSessionEvaluation
    from moabb.paradigms import LeftRightImagery
    from moabb.pipelines.features import LogVariance



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-45

In order to create pipelines within a script, you will likely need at least
the make_pipeline function. They can also be specified via a .yml file. Here
we will make a couple pipelines just for convenience

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-49

.. code-block:: Python



    moabb.set_log_level("info")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-58

Create pipelines
----------------

We create two pipelines: channel-wise log variance followed by LDA, and
channel-wise log variance followed by a cross-validated SVM (note that a
cross-validation via scikit-learn cannot be described in a .yml file). For
later in the process, the pipelines need to be in a dictionary where the key
is the name of the pipeline and the value is the Pipeline object

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-67

.. code-block:: Python


    pipelines = {}
    pipelines["AM+LDA"] = make_pipeline(LogVariance(), LDA())
    parameters = {"C": np.logspace(-2, 2, 10)}
    clf = GridSearchCV(SVC(kernel="linear"), parameters)
    pipe = make_pipeline(LogVariance(), clf)

    pipelines["AM+SVM"] = pipe


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-73

Datasets
-----------------

Datasets can be specified in many ways: Each paradigm has a property
'datasets' which returns the datasets that are appropriate for that paradigm

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-76

.. code-block:: Python


    print(LeftRightImagery().datasets)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-78

Or you can run a search through the available datasets:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-80

.. code-block:: Python

    print(utils.dataset_search(paradigm="imagery", min_subjects=6))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-83

Or you can simply make your own list (which we do here due to computational
constraints)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-88

.. code-block:: Python


    dataset = BNCI2014_001()
    dataset.subject_list = dataset.subject_list[:2]
    datasets = [dataset]


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-97

Paradigm
--------------------

Paradigms define the events, epoch time, bandpass, and other preprocessing
parameters. They have defaults that you can read in the documentation, or you
can simply set them as we do here. A single paradigm defines a method for
going from continuous data to trial data of a fixed size. To learn more look
at the tutorial Exploring Paradigms

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-102

.. code-block:: Python


    fmin = 8
    fmax = 35
    paradigm = LeftRightImagery(fmin=fmin, fmax=fmax)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-109

Evaluation
--------------------

An evaluation defines how the training and test sets are chosen. This could
be cross-validated within a single recording, or across days, or sessions, or
subjects. This also is the correct place to specify multiple threads.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-115

.. code-block:: Python


    evaluation = CrossSessionEvaluation(
        paradigm=paradigm, datasets=datasets, suffix="examples", overwrite=False
    )
    results = evaluation.process(pipelines)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 116-118

Results are returned as a pandas DataFrame, and from here you can do as you
want with them

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-120

.. code-block:: Python


    print(results.head())
