# Conductor PDG Scheduler for Houdini

A powerful scheduler that seamlessly integrates Houdini PDG graphs with the Conductor render farm, offering flexible submission strategies optimized for different workflow requirements.

## Version History
### Version 1.1.0-beta.32
- **New: Advanced PDG Execution Engine** with 7 specialized cooking methods
  - Auto-fallback mode (tries all methods sequentially)
  - Network execution (standard cookWorkItems with fallbacks)
  - PDG context cook (7 fallback strategies for complex networks)
  - Output node cook (targeted cooking with cascading fallbacks)
  - Scheduler execution (direct scheduler-based with work item generation)
  - Individual node cook (per-node execution with 6 methods each)
  - Dependency chain cook (topology-aware DAG execution)
- Added threaded cooking with progress monitoring and timeout handling
- Improved compatibility across different PDG network types and schedulers

### Version 1.1.0-beta.32
- Add support for SideFXLabs ML/CV nodes in PDG workflows

### Version 1.1.0-beta.26
- Fix PDG execution on Houdini 21 by setting PDG_SCRIPTDIR environment variable

### Version 1.1.0-beta.25
- Synchronized local and cloud output dir path mappings

### Version 1.1.0-beta.22
## PDG Universal Wrapper Improvements

* **Implemented wedge fallback mechanism**: Created manual rendering pipeline that executes when work items are not generated

* **Enhanced file collection system**: Fixed output tracking to properly capture both PDG-generated files and fallback renders, including token expansion (__PDG_DIR__) and directory scanning for unreported outputs

* **Fixed execution mode issue on Windows platform**: Resolved path handling and process execution compatibility issues specific to Windows environments

* **Fixed render directory on Windows**: Corrected Windows path separator handling and directory creation for render outputs to ensure proper file organization
  
### Version 1.1.0-beta.20
## 1. TOP Network Discovery
Fixed the on_schedule callback node hierarchy traversal:
- **Issue**: Callback stopped at intermediate TOP HDAs instead of finding root topnet
- **Solution**: Modified traversal logic to continue up through TOP HDAs to locate the actual topnet container

## 2. HDA Asset Collection  
Enhanced assets.py to automatically detect scene HDAs:
- **User HDAs**: Automatically collects and uploads project-specific HDA files
- **System Filtering**: Excludes Houdini built-in and package HDAs from upload list

## 3. Path Transformations
Synchronized local and cloud path mappings:
- **Output Path**: Applied Conductor transformations to maintain correct output directory references
- **PDG_RENDER_DIR**: Ensured environment variable stays synchronized between local and cloud environments

## 4. Folder Creation Cleanup
Optimized directory structure management:
- **Removed**: Eliminated unnecessary folder creation in user home directory
- **Preserved**: Maintained PDG required pdgtemp folder for proper workflow execution

### Version 1.1.0-beta.19
- Apply Conductor path transformations to ensure output path and PDG_RENDER_DIR environment variable remain synchronized after cloud upload
### Version 1.1.0-beta.18
## 1. Test Geometry Node Support
Enhanced Conductor Scheduler to properly handle Houdini built-in test geometries:
- Filtered out internal opdef: paths that were blocking render farm uploads
- Added HH/scripts to PATH environment variable and HHP/pdgjob for PDG script execution
- Configured HOUDINI_PATH with resource directories (HH/geo, HH/pic, HH/glsl) to access built-in assets like pig.bgeo.sc

## 2. Thread Count Configuration
Added use_max_processors parameter with three modes:
- **Manual**: User-defined thread count entry
- **All Processors**: Use all available processors
- **All Minus One**: Use all processors except one for system stability

## 3. HIP File Versioning Fix
Corrected file versioning behavior to save incremental versions in the same directory as the original HIP file rather than temporary directories

### Version 1.1.0-beta.17
* Updating dependencies

### Version 1.1.0-beta.8
* **Extended TOP network container support** - Now compatible with all container types (topnet, topnetmgr, etc.)
* Renamed parameters with "pdg_" to "conductor_" to avoid errors
* **Improved progress tab UI** - Increased button height for better accessibility
* **Enhanced Scheduler submission diagnostics** - Added detailed logging throughout the submission pipeline

### Version 1.1.0-beta.7
- Updating Conductor scheduler log level

### Version 1.1.0-beta.6
- Output path calculation improvement

### Version 1.1.0-beta.5
- Fixed critical UI display issues in Houdini 21 ensuring seamless parameter rendering and compatibility across versions
- Developed intelligent two-tab configuration system with automatic parameter scaling based on instance type detection (CPU cores/GPU count)
- **Execution Tab**: Dynamic PDG slot allocation, adaptive cook modes (Aggressive/Parallel/Hybrid), auto-scaled memory pools (1GB→16GB), parallel I/O with compression
- **Optimization Tab**: Multi-GPU management (CUDA/OptiX), renderer-specific settings (Karma/Mantra/Arnold/Redshift), single-machine NUMA optimization, real-time performance profiling

### Version 1.1.0-beta.2
## Submission Methods

### 1. Distributed Processing
  - Enabled via `Submit Each Work Item On a Single Machine` option
  - Distributes individual work items across multiple machines in the farm
  - Enables massive parallelization and optimal resource utilization
  - Each work item runs independently on its assigned machine

### 2. Single Machine Processing
  - Consolidates all work items onto a single high-spec machine
  - Perfect for workflows requiring:
    - Shared memory access
    - Inter-dependent simulations
    - Scenarios where overhead from distribution outweighs parallelization benefits

## Key Benefits

- **Seamless Scaling** - From local prototyping to massive farm deployments
- **Intelligent Batching** - Reduces submission overhead
- **Automatic Versioning** - Ensures reproducible results
- **Environment Management** - Comprehensive support for complex pipeline integrations

*   Added validation checks to flag image output paths that are too shallow such as root level directories.

**Husk Submitter**
*   Refined USD dependency scraping for more reliable and accurate asset resolution.
*   Optimized the submission process by removing unnecessary extra files from uploads, reducing transfer times.

**ROP Submitter & General ROP Handling**
*   Dedicated ROP submitter

* Conductor Submitter Redesign: 
* Introducing 3 New Nodes — Solaris, Husk, and ROP Nodes
* We undertook a comprehensive redesign of the Houdini Conductor Submitter to elevate its functionality and user experience. 
* The updated design focuses on streamlining workflows, enhancing usability, and providing tailored solutions for diverse rendering tasks.
* By introducing distinct submitter nodes with customized parameters and workflows, we’ve ensured that users can focus on their specific needs without unnecessary clutter or complexity.


## Version:0.7.15 -- 20 Aug 2024
* LOPs node reference is now included in scraping
