- Remember to check for updates in AGENTS.md when making changes. This file is for AI Assistants like Claude Code so I expect that you maintain it as well.

## Versioning

- Pre-release versions MUST use a hyphen before the pre-release identifier
- Examples: `1.0.0-a13`, `1.0.0-b1`, `1.0.0-rc1`
- NOT: `1.0.0a13`, `1.0.0b1` (no hyphen is incorrect)
