              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Python SDK for the Behavioral Signals API. Behavioral Signals builds AI solutions that understand human behavior through voice and detect deepfake content in audio.
Our API enables developers to integrate behavioral analysis into their applications, both in batch and streaming modes.

    * [Deepfakes API Batch Mode](#deepfakes-api-batch-mode)
    * [Deepfakes API Streaming Mode](#deepfakes-api-streaming-mode)

## Features

- **Behavioral Analysis API** : Analyze human behavior in both batch (offline) and streaming (online) modes.

- **Deepfake Detection API**: Detect synthetic or manipulated speech using advanced deepfake detection models.  
  - Supports batch (offline) and streaming (online) modes  
  - Compatible with a wide range of spoken languages

- **Core Speech Attributes (Batch Only)**: Extract foundational conversational metadata from both APIs:  
  - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)  
  - Speaker Diarization  
  - Language Identification

## Requirements

* `Python3.10+`,
* `ffmpeg`,
* Python dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml`


## API Key Setup

To use the Behavioral Signals API, you need to create an account and obtain an API key from the [Behavioral Signals portal](https://portal.behavioralsignals.com/).

## SDK Installation

```bash
pip install behavioralsignals
```

## SDK Example Usage

After obtaining your API key, you can use the SDK to interact with the Behavioral Signals APIs.
We currently provide two main APIs:

* the **Behavioral API** for analyzing human behavior through voice, and
* the **Deepfakes API** for detecting deepfake audio content in human speech.

Both APIs support batch and streaming modes, allowing you to send audio files or streams for analysis and receive results after processing and in real-time, respectively.
You can also find more detailed examples for both [batch](examples/batch/README.md) and [streaming](examples/streaming/README.md) in the `examples/` directory.

### Behavioral API Batch Mode

In batch mode, you can send audio files to the Behavioral Signals API for analysis. The API will return a unique process ID (PID) that you can use to retrieve the results later.

```python
from behavioralsignals import Client

client = Client(YOUR_CID, YOUR_API_KEY)

response = client.behavioral.upload_audio(file_path="audio.wav")
output = client.behavioral.get_result(pid=response.pid)
```

Setting `embeddings=True` during audio upload will include speaker and behavioral embeddings in the output (see [documentation](https://behavioralsignals.readme.io/v5.4.0/docs/embeddings#/)):

```python
response = client.behavioral.upload_audio(file_path="audio.wav", embeddings=True)
output = client.behavioral.get_result(pid=response.pid)
```

### Behavioral API Streaming Mode

In streaming mode, you can send audio data in real-time to the Behavioral Signals API. The API will return results as they are processed.

```python
from behavioralsignals import Client, StreamingOptions
from behavioralsignals.utils import make_audio_stream

client = Client(YOUR_CID, YOUR_API_KEY)
audio_stream, sample_rate = make_audio_stream("audio.wav", chunk_size=250)
options = StreamingOptions(sample_rate=sample_rate, encoding="LINEAR_PCM")

for result in client.behavioral.stream_audio(audio_stream=audio_stream, options=options):
    print(result)
```

### Deepfakes API Batch Mode

A similar example for the Deepfakes API in batch mode allows you to send audio files for deepfake detection:

```python
from behavioralsignals import Client

client = Client(YOUR_CID, YOUR_API_KEY)

response = client.deepfakes.upload_audio(file_path="audio.wav")
output = client.deepfakes.get_result(pid=response.pid)
```

Setting `embeddings=True` during audio upload will include speaker and deepfake embeddings in the output (see [documentation](https://behavioralsignals.readme.io/v5.4.0/docs/embeddings-1#/)):

```python
response = client.deepfakes.upload_audio(file_path="audio.wav", embeddings=True)
output = client.deepfakes.get_result(pid=response.pid)
```


#### 🔬 Experimental: Deepfake Generator Prediction (Batch Only)

An experimental option is now available that attempts to predict the generator model used to produce a deepfake.
When enabled, the returned results will contain an additional field - only for audios with detected deepfake content - indicating the predicted generator model along with a confidence score.

You can activate this feature by passing `enable_generator_detection=True` during audio upload:

```python
from behavioralsignals import Client

client = Client(YOUR_CID, YOUR_API_KEY)

response = client.deepfakes.upload_audio(file_path="audio.wav", enable_generator_detection=True)
output = client.deepfakes.get_result(pid=response.pid)
```

See more in our [API documentation](https://behavioralsignals.readme.io/v5.4.0/docs/generator-detection#/).

### Deepfakes API Streaming Mode

A similar streaming example for the Deepfakes API allows you to send audio data in real-time for speech deepfake detection:

```python
from behavioralsignals import Client, StreamingOptions
from behavioralsignals.utils import make_audio_stream

client = Client(YOUR_CID, YOUR_API_KEY)
audio_stream, sample_rate = make_audio_stream("audio.wav", chunk_size=250)
options = StreamingOptions(sample_rate=sample_rate, encoding="LINEAR_PCM")

for result in client.deepfakes.stream_audio(audio_stream=audio_stream, options=options):
    print(result)
```
