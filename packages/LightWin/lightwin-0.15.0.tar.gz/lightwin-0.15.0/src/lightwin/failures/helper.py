    tie_politics :
        When two elements have the same position, will you want to have the
        upstream or the downstream first?

        Distance increase for downstream elements (``shift < 0``) or upstream
        elements (``shift > 0``). Used to have a window of compensating

    Returns

        Will be used as a primary sorting key.
