# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.15.0] -- 2025-12-11

### Added

- In the `[wtf]` section of the `TOML` configuration file:
  - `id_nature` can be set to `"lattice"` or `"section"`. The indexes listed in
    `failed` will then be lattice or section index.
  - `index_offset = 1` optional configuration key makes indexes in `failed` and
    `compensating_manual` start at `1` instead of `0`. With this option,
    `failed = [[50]]` means the 50th cavity/element, not the 51st.
  - New entry `automatic_study`. Two values allowed for now: `"single
cavity failures"` and `"cryomodule failures"`. All the cavities/cryomodules
    indicated in `failed` will be failed one after another. Typical usage; this
    will run a systematic study of all single cavity failures in the second
    section.

```toml
automatic_study = "single cavity failures"
failed = [1]
id_nature = "section"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This new feature introduced a new dependency between `AcceleratorFactory` and
> `FaultScenarioFactory`. If you created your `Accelerator` and `FaultScenario`
> yourself instead of using utility functions from the `ui` module,
> `automatic_study` will not be supported.

## [0.14.1] -- 2025-12-10

### Changed

- Deprecated numpy API in Cython is no longer used.
- The `Accelerator` factories `NoFault` and `WithFault` are deprecated. Prefer
  the general purpose `AcceleratorFactory`.

### Fixed

- The `k_b` parameter of `FIELD_MAP` was not updated.
  - We always keep it equal to `k_e` for now.

## [0.14.0] -- 2025-12-04

### Added

- Explicit Cython optional dependency in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed

- Refactored the `RfField` class, which is now called `Field`.
  - Opens up the way for DC and 3D fields support.
    - `FIELD_MAP 7700` is partially supported: motion is integrated on axis.
  - Massive speed-up w.r.t 0.13.5:
    - `Envelope1D` is ~40% faster.
    - `CyEnvelope1D` is ~50% faster.
    - `Envelope3D` is ~25% faster. Note that it is not fully optimized.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter a "wrong number of attributes" error using `CyEnvelope1D`, it
> means that Cython modules were not recompiled. Recompile the Cython modules
> following [the classic instructions](https://lightwin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/installation.cython.html).

## [0.13.5] -- 2025-11-27

### Changed

- Modernized the `experimental` module: `Plotter`, `SimulationOutputEvaluator`.
  _Write some tutorial before official functionality release._

### Fixed

- Cython solver was not used even if configuration asked for it.

## [0.13.4] -- 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- Release workflow on macos os 13 was [not supported anymore](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/13046).

## [0.13.3] -- 2025-11-25

### Fixed

- Removed `pymoo` dependencies and `NSGA` algorithm to avoid build errors.

## [0.13.2] -- 2025-11-25

### Fixed

- Bad output path resolution due to a merge conflict.

## [0.13.1] -- 2025-11-25

### Changed

- `export_phase` is now a mandatory configuration entry for beam calculators.
  Former default behavior is preserved: if this entry is not given, we set it to
  `"as_in_cavity_settings"`.

### Fixed

- Field map phase is correctly exported in the `DAT` files.
- Ensured that the `default_value` of configuration entries are used.
- TraceWin compensation works again.

## [0.13.0] -- 2025-11-05

### Added

- SNS-like compensation method:
  - Activate it with `reference_phase_policy = "phi_s"`, `strategy = "corrector
at exit"` and `"objective_preset = "CorrectorAtExit"`.
  - `n_compensating` cavities around each failure are used to keep energy
    longitudinal shape "reasonable".
    - `n_compensating = 0` is currently not supported.
  - All downstream cavities are rephased to preserve longitudinal acceptance.
  - Final `n_correctors` cavities accelerate the beam to retrieve nominal energy.

### Deprecated

- All the `Objective` subclasses are now in the `lightwin.optimisation.objective
.objective` module. Old import paths still work but raise a warning when used.
  The `Objective` subclasses are:
  - `MinimizeDifferenceWithRef`
  - `MinimizeMismatch`
  - `QuantityIsBetween`

## [0.12.1] -- 2025-08-26

### Changed

- More consistent documentation of parameters type.

### Fixed

- `cython` transfer matrices were not used

## [0.12.0] -- 2025-08-25

### Added

- The cavities reference phase is now determined by `reference_phase_policy`.
  - This is more permissive than `flag_phi_abs`, that could only be `True` or `False`.
  - Now, reference phase can be `phi_0_abs`, `phi_0_rel`, `phi_s` or `as_in_dat_file`!

### Changed

- The `CavitySettings` object, and in particular its handling of phases and reference phases, is more robust.
  - This update introduced significant changes: do not hesitate [to file an issue](https://github.com/AdrienPlacais/LightWin/issues) if you encounter `MissingAttributeError`, or any phase-related error.

### Deprecated

- Do not use the `TOML` `flag_phi_abs` configuration entry anymore, prefer `reference_phase_policy`.
  - If `flag_phi_abs` is found, a deprecation warning is raised.
  - For now, `flag_phi_abs` as precedence over `reference_phase_policy` to keep backward compatibility.

## [0.11.4] -- 2025-08-21

### Added

- New Sphinx directive to nicely display dictionaries.
  - Check [example](https://lightwin.readthedocs.io/en/0.11.x/manual/configuration.wtf.html#wtf-section)
- Support for Bayesian Optimization `kwargs`.

### Fixed

- Selection of `simulated_annealing` was in fact not possible.

## [0.11.3] -- 2025-08-20

### Added

- New optimization algorithms:
  - Simulated Annealing.
  - Bayesian Optimization.

## [0.11.2] -- 2025-08-20

### Fixed

- Dummy import error in test suite.

## [0.11.1] -- 2025-08-20

### Changed

- Tables listing configuration options are more consistent in the html documentation.

## [0.11.0] -- 2025-08-19

### Added

- Calculation of energy and phase acceptances (#5).
- New `physics` package holding helper physical functions (#6).
- New plot preset: `acceptance`.
- Explicit error message when trying to plot some bugged quantities:
  - Transfer matrix components (TraceWin)
  - Phase acceptance (TraceWin)

### Fixed

- Objective position was plotted at the wrong place when the x-axis of plot was index of elements.
- `r_zdelta` components can be `get` and plotted using `transfer_matrix` plot preset.
- Symmetric plot (`envelope`, `acceptance`) work as expected.

## [0.10.6] -- 2025-07-04

### Added

- Documentation for `setuptools_scm` issues when downloading LightWin as an archive.

## [0.10.5] -- 2025-07-01

### Fixed

- Missing dependencies in linux Github Actions wheel builder.

## [0.10.4] -- 2025-07-01

### Added

- Introduced `BeamKwargs` typing. Easier to know the values stored in this object.

## [0.10.3] -- 2025-06-30

### Fixed

- Bug introduced in the beam parameters test by 0.10.2.

## [0.10.2] -- 2025-06-30

### Fixed

- `MinimizeDifferenceWithRef` residuals func now returns an always positive value.
  - Does not make any difference with `OptimisationAlgorithm` such as `LeastSquares` which take the squared residuals. May be a game changer for other algorithms.
- Flag to handle `SimulationOutput.get(..., elt=elt)` when `elt: Element` is not in `SimulationOutput.elts`.
  - Fixed some errors at `Objective` creation.

## [0.10.1] -- 2025-06-06

### Fixed

- Update of `CITATION.cff`, `CHANGELOG.md`

## [0.10.0] -- 2025-06-06

### Added

- `release.py` script, `CONTRIBUTING.md` to ease collaboration.

### Changed

- `Accelerator.get`, `SimulationOutput.get`, `ListOfElements.get` now accept arguments found in `FieldMap`.
  - _e.g._: `ListOfElements.get("freq_cavity_mhz")` is now valid.

## [0.10.0rc0] -- 2025-05-12

### Changed

- Refactored the `get` methods.
  - It may introduce some bugs, do not hesitate to reach me out in case of problem.

### Fixed

- `get` refactoring fixed several bugs:
  - Some `get` methods such as `SimulationOutput.get` did not consider the `phase_space_name` keyword argument.
  - `get` methods behavior are more consistent.

<!-- Adhere to development best practices. -->
<!-- In particular, follow advices listed in the great [Scientific Python library development guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/). -->

## [0.9.4] -- 2025-05-06

### Added

- Added `get` examples in the example notebook.

## [0.9.3] -- 2025-04-09

### Fixed

- The `lightwin.config_manager` symlink pointing to `lightwin.config.config_manager` did not resolve on Windows.
  It was deleted and all `import lightwin.config_manager` were replaced by `import lightwin.config.config_manager`.

### Changed

- `import lightwin.config_manager` no longer works! Replace all occurrences by `import lightwin.config.config_manager`.

## [0.9.2] -- 2025-04-07

### Added

- Type hints for the `.get` methods.
- Notebook example to showcase how LightWin can be used.
- You can give `matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` kwargs in the `plots` TOML section.

  - Automatic checking of common mistakes with `pre-commit.ci`.
  - Run automatic tests using `pytest` and GitHub workflows.
- Badges to quickly see if something went wrong.

### Changed

- Introduced optional dependencies.
  - Install them with `pip install -e .[docs]` or `pip install -e .[test]`.
  - It is recommended to install LightWin with the test optional dependencies.

## [0.8.4] 2025-01-15

### Changed

- Tests now rely on the `pytest.approx` functions, much cleaner than previous approach.

## [0.8.3] 2025-01-13

### Added

- Version number and commit number are written in the log file.

### Fixed

- Properly handle opening/closing log files.
- Display of some objective values.

## [0.8.2] 2024-11-11

### Added

- Utility scripts in `ui/workflow_setup.py` defining generic LightWin workflows.
- User can provide `fault_scenario_factory` with a `ObjectivesFactory` to define objectives without altering the source code.
- The `add_objective` in the [plots] TOML table to show position of objective.

## [0.8.0b4] 2024-11-08

### Added

- `SimulationOutput.plot()` method, that calls `.get` under the hood and takes in the same arguments.
- Non-normalized emittance is stored under `non_norm_eps`. Ex: `SimulationOutput.get("non_norm_eps_phiw")`.

### Changed

- Normalized emittances are explicitly marked as normalized in the output.

## [0.8.0b3] 2024-11-07

### Added

- `SET_SYNC_PHASE` commands are now handled for export in DAT file.
- It is now possible to use the `export_phase` in the `[beam_calculator]` table to choose the type of phase to put in the output DAT file.

### Changed

- Display of cavity parameters in `cav.png`, so that 2nd solver does not hide 1st.

### Fixed

- Calculating `phi_0_abs` of a cavity when the reference was `phi_s` raised error.
- `path_cal` not existing in `TraceWin` raised error instead of just creating the folder.
- Interpolation of Twiss to compute mismatch factor was bugged.

## [0.8.0b2] 2024-11-05

### Fixed

- Fixed several bugs that were outside the scope of my pytests.
  - `beam_calc_post` configuration key was no longer recognized.
  - Not providing the `project_folder` key in the `[files]` TOML table led to bug.
  - Some elements created bugs in `CyEnvelope1D`.

## [0.8.0b1] 2024-11-04

### Fixed

- Dot characters in field map file names do not throw an error anymore.
- When several `Element` objects have the same `_personalized_name`, a fallback name and a warning is raised instead of raising an `AssertionError`.

### Changed

- Creation of `DatLine` object, holding a line of the `.dat` file. Solves several bugs, e.g. with hyphens in personalized names.
- Makefile for docs is up-to-date. Instructions in README.
- Changed location of `RfField` object, now in `core/em_field/rf_field`.
- The solver `Envelope1D` is now `CyEnvelope1D` when user wants Cython.

## [0.8.0b0] 2024-10-22

### Changed

- The configuration manager was refactored.
- `NewRfField` object officially replaces `RfField`.
- The configurations for the different objects are now in the `specs.py` files, in the same folder as the object they instantiate.

### Deleted

- Constants were removed from the config module to fix circular dependency and bad design issues.
- `BeamCalculator` objects now need to be given the `beam` configuration dict. Easiest is to instantiate `BeamCalculatorFactory` with `**config`.
- `Accelerator` will also use data from `beam`. Instantiate `AcceleratorFactory` with `**config`.
- `SimulationOutputFactory` instantiated with `_beam_kwargs`.

## [0.7.0] 2024-10-22

### Added

- Better display of units in documentation with the new `:unit:` role.

## [0.7.0b3] 2024-10-09

### Added

- Documentation has links to documentation from other libraries (numpy etc).

### Changed

- Documentation is nitpicky.

### Fixed

- Loading function of `evaluations.csv` in `lw-combine-solutions` to handle trailing whitespaces.
- Documentation generation does not raise warnings anymore (except for pymoo).

## [0.7.0b2] 2024-10-01

### Fixed

- Updated path to scripts in `pyproject.toml`; they should work again!

### Changed

- Table of Contents does not show the full path to every module/package anymore. The API section should be much clearer now!
- Better display of the constants in the doc

## [0.7.0b1] 2024-09-30

### Fixed

- Scripts moved to the `lightwin` module so that they can actually be imported.
- `outfolder` argument in `combine-solutions` script is automatically created if it does not exist.
- Documentation includes the API reference again.
- Most of the errors raised during documentation compilation were fixed.

## [0.7.0b0] 2024-09-26

### Fixed

- Released constraints on the versions of installed packages.

## [0.7.0b] 2024-08-07

### Changed

- The code is packaged.
- Installation instructions were updated.
- It is not necessary to add LightWin to your `PATH`.
- Imports of LightWin modules and functions must be imported from `lightwin`: `from lightwin.<foo> import <fee>`.
- Cython compilation is automatic.

## [0.6.21] 2024-06-07

### Added

- Support for `REPEAT_ELE` command.
- Basic support for `SET_SYNC_PHASE`. This command can be kept in the input `.dat`, but output `.dat` will hold relative or absolute phase (determined by the `BeamCalculator.reference_phase`).

### Changed

- When creating the `BeamCalculator`, prefer `method="RK4"` over `method="RK"` for 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

## [0.6.20] 2024-05-31

### Added

- Basic support for `ADJUST` commands
- New functionality: pass beauty.
- After a `FaultScenario` is fixed, use `insert_beauty_pass_instructions` from `util.beauty_pass` to add diagnostics and adjust and let TraceWin refine the settings.
- Prefer providing `TraceWin` with `cancel_matchingP = true` (would be too long).
- Do NOT provide `cancel_matching = true` nor `cancel_matching = false`. Just drop this argument out (FIXME).
- Compensating, rephased and failed cavities will be incorrectly displayed as nominal (green) cavities in the output figures (FIXME).

### Fixed

- Personalized name of field maps 1100, 100 and of quadrupoles are now exported in output dat file.
- Note that this is a temporary patch, a more robust solution will be implemented in future updates.

## [0.6.19] 2024-05-27

### Added

- Support for the TraceWin command line arguments: `algo`, `cancel_matching` and `cancel_matchingP`
- You can provide a `shift` key in `wtf` to shift the window of compensating cavities.
  - Example with 4 compensating lattices:
    - `shift=0` -> 2 upstream and 2 downstream compensating lattices
    - `shift=+1` -> 1 upstream and 3 downstream compensating lattices
    - `shift=-1` -> 3 upstream and 1 downstream compensating lattices
- `Variable`/`Constraint` limits can be changed after creation with the `change_limits` method.
- You can override the default kwargs in the `OptimisationAlgorithm` actual algo.
- Support for pickling/unpickling objects.
  - In other words: some objects such as `Accelerator` or `SimulationOutput` can be saved in binary format, so they can be reloaded and reused in a later Python instance without the hassle of recreating and recomputing everything.

### Changed

- A configuration file is mandatory to select the TraceWin executables.

### Fixed

- SimulationOutput created by TraceWin have a `is_multiparticle` attribute that matches reality.
- Position envelopes are now plotted in deg instead of degdeg (1degdeg = 180 / pi deg).

## [0.6.18] 2024-04-23

### Added

- You can forbid a cavity from being retuned (ex: a rebuncher which is here to rebunch, not to try funny beamy things). Just set `my_cavity.can_be_retuned = False`.
- By default, a lattice without any retunable cavity is skipped when selecting the compensating cavities; this behavior can be modified by setting a `min_number_of_cavities_in_lattice` with `l neighboring lattices` method in the configuration.

### Changed

- New typing features impose the use of Python 3.12.
- The `idx` key in the `wtf` dictionary is now called `id_nature`, which can be one of the following:
  - `cavity`: we consider that `failed = [[10]]` means "the 10th cavity is down".
  - `element`: we consider that `failed = [[10]]` means "the 10th element is down". If the 10th element is not a cavity, an error is raised.
  - `name`: we consider that `failed = [["FM10"]]` means "the first element which name is 'FM10' is down".
- With the `l neighboring lattices` strategy, `l` can now be odd.
- You can provide `tie_strategy = "downstream first"` or `tie_strategy = "upstream first"` to favour up/downstream cavities when there is a tie in distance between compensating cavities/lattices and failed.

### Fixed

- Colors in Evaluator plots are now reset between executions

## [0.6.17] 2024-04-19

### Added

- Switch between different phases at `.dat` save.

### Fixed

- With the `"sync_phase_amplitude"` design space, the synchronous phases were saved in the `.dat` and labelled as relative phase (no `SET_SYNC_PHASE`).

## [0.6.16] 2024-04-17

### Added

- New design space `"rel_phase_amplitude_with_constrained_sync_phase"`
- Pytest for basic compensation with all `BeamCalculator`
- Pytest for every `Design Space`

### Deprecated

- Some design space names are not to be used.
- `"unconstrained"` -> `"abs_phase_amplitude"`
- `"unconstrained_rel"` -> `"rel_phase_amplitude"`
- `"constrained_sync_phase"` -> `"abs_phase_amplitude_with_constrained_sync_phase"`
- `"sync_phase_as_variable"` -> `"sync_phase_amplitude"`

### Removed

- Support for `.ini` configuration files.
- `"phi_s_fit"` entry in configuration (use the proper design space config entry instead)

### Fixed

- Lattices and their indexes correctly set.
- Synchronous phases correctly calculated and updated; can be used as a variable again.

# Future updates

## [0.?.??] 2024-??-?? -- branch under development

### Changed

- `evaluator` objects are more robust and can be configured from the `.toml`.
- Plotting is now performed thanks to the `plotter` library.

### Added

- `FIELD_MAP 70` does not raise error (warning issued with `Envelope3D`: no transverse tracking).
- `SUPERPOSE_MAP` will be implemented for 1D maps (warning issued with `Envelope3D`: no transverse tracking).
