    r"""Return ``k out of n`` cavities, plus additional cavities at exit.

    The idea behind this strategy is the following:

    - Use ``n_compensating`` cavities around the failure to shape the beam and
      propagate it without losses.
    - Rephase downstream cavities to keep the beam as intact as possible.

      - ``reference_phase_policy = "phi_s"`` is the best choice to preserve
        longitudinal acceptance along the linac.
    - Give an ultimate energy boost to the beam with the last ``n_correctors``
      cavities.

      - The :class:`.ObjectiveFactory` must set different objectives at the
        linac exit than at the compensation zone(s) exit.

    This method is inspired by Shishlo and Peters who tested it on SNS
    superconducting linac :cite:`Shishlo2022`; they used
    ``n_compensating = 0``, which is currently not supported by LightWin. It
    also showed very promising results on the SPIRAL2 superconducting linac
    :cite:`Placais2024b`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elements :
        All the tunable elements/lattices/sections.
    failed_elements :
        Failed cavities/lattice.
    n_compensating :
        Number of compensating cavity per failure; this is the ``k`` of the
        ``k out of n`` method.
    n_correctors :
        Number of corrector cavities at the exit of the linac.
    tie_politics :
        When two elements have the same position, will you want to have the
        upstream or the downstream first?
    shift :
        Distance increase for downstream elements (``shift < 0``) or upstream
        elements (``shift > 0``). Used to have a window of compensating
        cavities which is not centered around the failed elements.
    include_correctors :
        If corrector cavities should be included in returned list. If this
        function is called within :func:`.gather`, set it to ``False``. As all
        failed cavities of the linac would require these compensating cavities,
        it would mess up with the failures gathering. Current workaround is to
        add correctors manually after the :func:`.gather` call, in
        :func:`.failed_and_compensating`.

    -------
