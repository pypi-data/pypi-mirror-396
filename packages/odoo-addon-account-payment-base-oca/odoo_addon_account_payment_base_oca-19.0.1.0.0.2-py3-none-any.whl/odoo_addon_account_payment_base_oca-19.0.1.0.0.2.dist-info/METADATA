This is the new base module for the OCA project
**bank-payment-alternative**. As the name suggests, the OCA project
**bank-payment-alternative** is an alternative to the OCA project
**bank-payment**. The project **bank-payment-alternative** uses the
native payment method object of Odoo (model
*account.payment.method.line*) which has been introduced in Odoo v15 and
is used on partners and invoices since Odoo v18.

This module adds support for variable link between bank/cash journal and
payment method. A typical use case is for a company that has several
bank accounts and wants to have an outbound payment method *Wire
transfer to suppliers* which is not linked to a specific bank account
and decide which bank account will be debited when confirming the
payment order.

This module also adds support for the display of partially scrambled
bank account numbers. This is useful for some inbound payment methods
where the company debits the bank account of its customers and the
company wants to show on its customer invoices the bank account number
that will be debited without printing the full bank account number, but
print it partially scrambled.
