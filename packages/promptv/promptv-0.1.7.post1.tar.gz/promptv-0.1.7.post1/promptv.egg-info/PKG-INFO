              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

WARNING: This is a pre-release version of promptv. Expect breaking changes.

# promptv - Prompt Versioning CLI Tool & Environment Variable Management Tool

A command-line interface tool for managing prompts locally with versioning support.

## Features

- Local prompt management with version control
<!-- - Cloud storage support with API key and project ID -->
- Markdown format support for all prompts
- Automatic directory creation on first run
- Full version history tracking
- Multiple prompt operations (create, update, retrieve, list, delete)
- Variable substitution with Jinja2 templates
- Tag/label system for easy version references
- Cost estimation for LLM API calls
- Project-based organization for prompts and secrets
- Git-style diff visualization

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd promptv

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install from Pypi
pip install promptv==0.1.7 #lock the version to avoid API changes
```

## Configuration

### First-time Setup

Initialize promptv to create the required directory structure:

```bash
promptv init
```

This creates:

```
~/.promptv/
├── .config/
│   ├── config.yaml      # User configuration
│   └── pricing.yaml     # LLM pricing data (customizable)
├── .secrets/
│   └── secrets.json     # API keys and secrets
├── cache/               # Cache directory
├── presets/             # Presets directory
├── prompts/             # Saved prompts
└── sessions/            # Sessions directory
```

**Note:** promptv will automatically initialize on first command if not already done.

On first run, promptv creates `~/.promptv/.config/config.yaml` with default settings.

### Execution Modes

**Local Mode (default)**: Stores all data in `~/.promptv/`

```yaml
execution:
  mode: "local"
```

### LLM Provider Configuration

Configure API base URLs for different LLM providers:

```yaml
llm_providers:
  openai:
    api_base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    default_model: "gpt-4"
  anthropic:
    api_base_url: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
    default_model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
  cohere:
    api_base_url: "https://api.cohere.ai/v1"
    default_model: "command-r-plus"
  google:
    api_base_url: "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1"
    default_model: "gemini-pro"
  together:
    api_base_url: "https://api.together.xyz/v1"
    default_model: "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf"
  custom:
    api_base_url: "http://localhost:8000/v1"
    default_model: "custom-model"
```

### Customizing LLM Pricing

You can customize LLM pricing by editing `~/.promptv/.config/pricing.yaml`. This allows you to:

- Update pricing for existing models
- Add new models
- Adjust pricing for local/custom models

The file is copied from package resources during initialization and never auto-updated.

    # Test with custom endpoint
    promptv test custom-prompt --llm my-model --endpoint http://localhost:8000/v1
    
    # Test with custom endpoint and API key (security warning will be shown)
    promptv test custom-prompt --llm my-model --custom-endpoint https://api.example.com/v1/chat --api-key sk-12345
    
    # Test with specific version and parameters
    promptv test my-prompt --llm gpt-4 --provider openai --version 2 --temperature 0.7
    ```

## Secrets Management

promptv provides secure storage for API keys and generic secrets:

### Provider API Keys

Store API keys for supported LLM providers (openai, anthropic, cohere, etc.):

```bash
# Set provider API key (validated)
promptv secrets set openai --provider
promptv secrets set anthropic --provider

# Get provider key (shows last 4 chars only)
promptv secrets get openai --provider

# Delete provider key
promptv secrets delete openai --provider
```

### Generic Secrets

Store any secrets with optional project scoping:

```bash
# Default project
promptv secrets set DATABASE_URL
promptv secrets set API_KEY

# Project-scoped
promptv secrets set DATABASE_URL --project my-app
promptv secrets set REDIS_URL --project moonshoot

# Retrieve secrets
promptv secrets get DATABASE_URL
promptv secrets get API_KEY --project my-app
```

### Listing Secrets

```bash
# List all secrets
promptv secrets list

# Example output:
# Provider API Keys:
#   ✓ openai
#   ✓ anthropic
#
# Project Secrets:
#   default:
#     ✓ DATABASE_URL
#     ✓ API_KEY
#
#   my-app:
#     ✓ DB_PASSWORD
#     ✓ REDIS_URL

# Filter by project
promptv secrets list --project my-app
```

### Exporting Secrets

Similar to `source .env`, you can export all secrets for a project to your current shell:

```bash
# Basic usage - export default project
source <(promptv secrets export)
promptv secrets export > .env

# Export specific project
source <(promptv secrets export --project moonshoot)

# Alternative syntax with eval
eval "$(promptv secrets export --project moonshoot)"

# Exclude provider API keys
source <(promptv secrets export --project moonshoot --no-include-providers)

# Different output formats
promptv secrets export --format json
promptv secrets export --format shell
promptv secrets export --format dotenv
```

**Shell Function Helper** (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
# Convenient alias for exporting secrets
promptv-export() {
    eval "$(promptv secrets export --format shell --project ${1:-default})"
}

# Usage:
promptv-export                # Export default project
promptv-export moonshoot      # Export moonshoot project
```

**How it works:**

- Exports all secrets for the specified project as environment variables
- Provider API keys are exported as `PROVIDER_API_KEY` (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Works like `source .env` but pulls from promptv's secure storage
- Changes only affect the current shell session

**Output formats:**

```bash
# Shell format (default) - includes export statements
promptv secrets export --project moonshoot --format shell

# Dotenv format (standard .env file format)
promptv secrets export --project moonshoot --format dotenv

# JSON format for other tools
promptv secrets export --project moonshoot --format json
```

### Security

- All secrets are stored in `~/.promptv/.secrets/secrets.json`
- File has restrictive permissions (0600 - owner read/write only)
- Secrets directory has restrictive permissions (0700 - owner access only)
- Provider API keys show only last 4 characters when retrieved

## Project Organization

**Default Behavior:** All prompts are automatically saved to the `default` project unless you specify otherwise.

```bash
# These commands save to ~/.promptv/prompts/default/
promptv commit --source prompt.md --name my-prompt
promptv set my-prompt -c "Content here"
promptv tag create my-prompt prod

# These commands save to ~/.promptv/prompts/my-app/
promptv commit --source prompt.md --name my-prompt --project my-app
promptv set my-prompt -c "Content here" --project my-app
promptv tag create my-prompt prod --project my-app
```

Use project tags to organize prompts and secrets:

```bash
# Set a prompt with project tag
promptv commit --source prompt.md --name my-prompt --project my-app

# Set project-scoped secret
promptv secrets set DATABASE_URL --project my-app

# Get secret for specific project
promptv secrets get DATABASE_URL --project my-app
```

## Variable Substitution

Prompts support Jinja2 template variables:

```markdown
Hello {{ name }},

Welcome to {{ product }}! Your account is ready.

Support: {{ support_email }}
```

Retrieve with variables:

```bash
promptv get welcome-email --var "name=Alice product=MyApp support_email=help@example.com"
```

Render with variables:

```bash
promptv render welcome-email --var "name=Alice product=MyApp support_email=help@example.com"
```

## Diff Visualization

The diff engine supports git-style markers:

- `--` : Deleted lines (red)
- `++` : Added lines (green)
- `~~` : Modified lines (yellow)
- `@@` : Context markers in unified diff

```bash
promptv diff my-prompt 1 2 --format side-by-side
```

## Examples

```bash
# Commit a prompt from a file
promptv commit --source my_prompt.txt --name chatgpt-instructions

# Create/update a prompt with direct content
promptv set summarization-prompt -c "Summarize the following text in 3 sentences."

# Get the latest version of a prompt with variables
promptv get email-template --var "name=John product=Widget"

# Render a prompt with variables
promptv render email-template --var "name=John product=Widget"

# Edit a prompt in your editor
promptv edit email-template

# Create a tag for production
promptv tag create email-template prod --version 3

# Get production version
promptv get email-template --label prod

# Compare versions
promptv diff email-template 2 3 --format side-by-side

# List all versions of a prompt
promptv list chatgpt-instructions

# Remove prompts
promptv remove chatgpt-instructions summarization-prompt --yes

# Set API key
promptv secrets set openai --provider

# Estimate cost
promptv cost estimate my-prompt --model gpt-4

# Export secrets to .env file
promptv secrets export --project my-app > .env
```
