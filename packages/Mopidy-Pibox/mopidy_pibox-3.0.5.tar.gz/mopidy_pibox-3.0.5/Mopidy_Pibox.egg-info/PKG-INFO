Installation
============

2. Start Mopidy::
		
		mopidy

3. Open your Mopidy URL (e.g. `http://localhost:6680`) and click *Pibox*


Configuration
=============

**Note:** In order to understand if people are using Pibox, `GoatCounter <https://www.goatcounter.com>`_ is used to track basic usage. It does not store any personal data. If you do not want analytics to be collected, you can disable it by setting the ``disable_analytics`` config option to ``true`` in your Mopidy config file.

Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for
Mopidy-Pibox to your Mopidy configuration file::

    [pibox]
    enabled = true
    offline = false
    default_skip_threshold = 3
    default_playlists =
      spotify:playlist:79inBfAlnfUB7i5kRthmWL
    disable_analytics = false

The following configuration values are available:

- ``pibox/enabled``: If the pibox extension should be enabled or not.
  Defaults to ``true``.

- ``pibox/offline``: If the extension should be used offline. Defaults to ``false``.

- ``pibox/default_skip_threshold``: The default number of votes required to skip a track. Defaults to ``3``.

- ``pibox/default_playlists``: The URIs of the default playlists to play from when starting a new session. Defaults to `a Spotify playlist of great party songs <https://open.spotify.com/playlist/79inBfAlnfUB7i5kRthmWL?si=e8a5da23f91048c2>`_. Save it to your Spotify library!

- ``pibox/disable_analytics``: Stops `GoatCounter <https://www.goatcounter.com>`_ analytics from being included in the Pibox web app. Defaults to ``false``.
