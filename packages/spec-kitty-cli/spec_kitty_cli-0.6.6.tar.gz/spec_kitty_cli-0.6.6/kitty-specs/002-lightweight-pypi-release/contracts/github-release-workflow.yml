# Contract: GitHub Actions Workflow for PyPI Publish

```yaml
name: Publish Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install tooling
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install build==1.* twine==5.* tomli==2.* pytest

      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m pytest

      - name: Validate release metadata
        run: python scripts/release/validate_release.py --tag "${GITHUB_REF_NAME}"

      - name: Build distributions
        run: python -m build

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
          verbose: true

      - name: Record artifact checksums
        if: success()
        run: |
          sha256sum dist/* > dist/SHA256SUMS.txt
          cat dist/SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Workflow MUST exit prior to upload when tests fail, metadata validation fails, or version mismatches are detected.
- Tag triggers MUST be limited to semantic versions prefixed with `v`.
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret MUST be required; run fails with explicit error if missing.
- Build artifacts MUST include both `*.whl` and `*.tar.gz` files.
