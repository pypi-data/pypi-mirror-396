# Claude Code Workflow

Anthropic’s **Claude Code** pairs naturally with Spec Kitty’s guardrails. This guide explains how to integrate the Claude CLI, wire the prompts, and keep the **Claude dashboard automation** in lockstep with the Spec Kitty kanban view.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed (`claude --version`).
- Spec Kitty project initialized with the `claude` agent selected.
- `.claude/commands/` directory generated by `spec-kitty init`.

## Workflow Overview

| Phase | Claude Code Usage | Spec Kitty Command |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Discovery | Prompt Claude to interview stakeholders | `/spec-kitty.specify` |
| Research | Summarize evidence and data model findings | `/spec-kitty.research` |
| Planning | Generate architecture briefs via Claude | `/spec-kitty.plan` |
| Tasks | Produce work packages and prompts that Claude can execute | `/spec-kitty.tasks` |
| Implementation | Run Claude on specific prompt files | `/spec-kitty.implement` |
| Review & Merge | Summarize results and follow-up tasks, then land the branch | `/spec-kitty.review`, `/spec-kitty.merge` |

## Setup Checklist

1. **Select Claude during project creation**
   ```bash
   spec-kitty init my-project --ai claude
   ```
   This copies Claude-specific commands into `.claude/commands/` and activates the automation scripts under `.kittify/scripts/`.

2. **Refresh Claude’s long-term context after planning**
   ```bash
   cd <feature worktree>
   .kittify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude
   ```
   The script injects new architecture decisions, tech stacks, and vocabulary into Claude’s context files. Re-run it whenever `plan.md` or `tasks.md` changes.

## Running Claude Against Prompts

Prompt files live under `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/<lane>/WPxx-slug.md`. Each contains:

- Mission-aligned context.
- Checklist of subtasks.
- Activity log for audit.

Launch Claude against a prompt:

```bash
cd .worktrees/001-systematic-recognizer-enhancement
claude prompt kitty-specs/001-systematic-recognizer-enhancement/tasks/doing/WP02-synthetic-benchmark.md
```

Claude will use the template metadata to understand scope, file boundaries, and Definition of Done.

## Dashboard Integration

- Lane transitions triggered by `.kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh` surface instantly on the kanban dashboard.
- Each lane move records `agent`, `assignee`, and `shell_pid` in prompt frontmatter—Claude should add an ISO 8601 entry to the **Activity Log** summarizing what changed.
- When Claude finishes a work package, use the helper script to move it to `for_review` so the dashboard and reviewers stay in sync:
  ```bash
  .kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh FEATURE-SLUG WP02 for_review --note "Ready for review"
  ```

## Recommended Automation

1. **Claude session bootstrapper:** Script that reads `meta.json` for the friendly feature name and injects it into Claude’s context.
2. **Claude completion validator:** Automatically checks that Claude’s output modifies only the allowed files referenced in the prompt.
3. **Claude dashboard notifier:** Sends Claude’s status updates to a team Slack channel whenever a work package changes lanes.
4. **Checklist watcher:** Parse `kitty-specs/<feature>/checklists/` and block Claude from moving prompts to `done` when acceptance criteria are unchecked.

## Troubleshooting Claude Sessions

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Claude asks for missing context | Prompt not in `doing` lane yet | Move prompt to `doing` so scripts inject metadata |
| Claude edits unexpected files | Prompt instructions unclear | Refine `tasks.md` and regenerate prompt |
| Dashboard shows stale lane | Prompt moved manually | Always use `.kittify/scripts/.../tasks-move-to-lane.sh` |
| Claude session interrupted | CLI lost connection | Resume using the prompt transcript stored under `.claude/history/` |

## Merge and Cleanup

Once Claude (and any partner agents) finish the feature:

1. Ensure `tasks/for_review/` is empty and all checklists are complete.
2. Run the guided merge:
 ```bash
  spec-kitty merge --remove-worktree
  ```
   Run it from the feature worktree; the CLI automatically performs the Git steps from the main checkout so worktrees stay in sync.
   The command documents merge steps, updates activity logs, and optionally removes the feature worktree to keep the repository tidy.

## Beyond Claude

- Mix Claude with Cursor or Gemini by generating commands for multiple agents during `spec-kitty init`.
- Keep the multi-agent orchestration playbook handy: [`multi-agent-orchestration.md`](multi-agent-orchestration.md).
- Review the scenario [`../examples/claude-cursor-collaboration.md`](../examples/claude-cursor-collaboration.md) for a dual-agent workflow.
