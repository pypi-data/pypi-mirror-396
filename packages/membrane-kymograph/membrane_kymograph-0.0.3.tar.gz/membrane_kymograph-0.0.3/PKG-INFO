_Membrane Kymograph Generator_, is a cross-platform, free and open-source, GUI-based application for generating kymographs from live-cell microscopy images along dynamic cell boundaries. Starting from a time-lapse image sequence and a whole cell binary mask, it automatically extracts the boundaries, corrects for the changes in the shape and size of the boundaries (using a custom algorithm), properly aligns the boundaries between different frames, samples intensities across the boundaries, and finally generates publication-quality kymographs in various formats.

## ✅ 📚 Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/tatsatb/membrane-kymograph-generator/wiki/Homepage) for detailed documentation. 

---


## 🚀 Quick Start

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/tatsatb/membrane-kymograph-generator/releases)** and check out the **[Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/tatsatb/membrane-kymograph-generator/wiki/Homepage)** to begin generating kymographs in minutes!

**No Python installation, dependency management, or programming knowledge is required - just download, install (or extract, if you are using standalone binaries), and run!**

---

## 🎁 Out of the box features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: An intuitive, interactive interface built with ttkbootstrap which allows easy navigation and parameter adjustments. 
- **Robust Input Validation**: TIFF format checking and dimension compatibility verification. 
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Save kymographs as PNG, SVG, and/or PDF
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Process multiple fluorescence channels simultaneously. 
- **Efficient Processing**:
  - Automatic boundary detection and smoothing via custom rotational offset algorithm. 
  - Circle fitting for perpendicular line generation
  - LOWESS smoothing for intensity profiles
  - Parallel processing via `joblib` for improved performance
- **Comprehensive Data Export**:
  - NumPy arrays (.npy) for all intermediate data
  - Excel files (.xlsx) for centroid positions and kymograph data
  - High-quality vector and raster visualizations
- **Interactive Post-Processing**: 
  - Fine-tune color limits after processing
  - Built-in correlation analysis tool (and statistical tests) for kymograph data
- **Native Python API**: For advanced users to enable batch processing (of large-scale datasets) and custom downstream spatiotemporal analyses (examples are provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/tatsatb/membrane-kymograph-generator/wiki/Advanced-Usage:-Python-API)).
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Available for both x86-64 and ARM64 systems running either Windows, macOS, and any standard Linux distribution. No installation of Python or any dependencies required. 

- **Open Source**: Free and open-source under the GPL v3 License.
