           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ScriptChat

A terminal-based, scriptable chat client for interacting with local LLMs (via Ollama)
and remote LLMs via OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek...) and Anthropic Claude.

## Why ScriptChat?

ScriptChat fills the gap between writing code against LLM APIs and using GUI chat interfaces. APIs give you control but high friction; GUIs are convenient but hard to automate. ScriptChat gives you both: an interactive TUI for exploration, and scriptable automation for testing and iteration.

- **Scriptable**: Write `.sc` scripts with variables and assertions. Pipe into shell workflows. Run prompt regression tests in CI.
- **Branchable**: Save a conversation, branch it, try different approaches, compare results.
- **Multi-provider**: Same workflow across Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic. Switch models mid-conversation.
- **File-based**: Conversations are directories of text files. Inspect, edit, or version control them.

For developers and power users who want their LLM interactions to be reproducible, scriptable, and under their control.

## Features

- Full-screen terminal UI with conversation history, status bar, and input pane
- Extended thinking support for reasoning models (`/reason`, `/thinking`)
- File references: register files and include them in prompts (`/file`, `@path`)
- Export conversations to Markdown, JSON, or HTML
- Multi-line message support
- Token usage tracking and temperature control
- System prompts per conversation

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Optional: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and accessible in your PATH

## Installation

### Via pipx (recommended)

```bash
pipx install scriptchat
```

This installs the `scriptchat` command (and the shorter `sc` alias) globally.

### Via pip

```bash
pip install scriptchat
```

### From source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scriptchat/scriptchat.git
   cd scriptchat
   ```

2. Install in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Quickstart

**Step 1**: Run interactive setup (one-time)
```bash
scriptchat --init
```
 
**Step 2**: Test it immediately with a real example
```bash
# Download and run a working script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quasientio/scriptchat/main/examples/quickstart.sc | sc
```
 
**Step 3**: Start chatting
```bash
sc
```
 
**Step 4**: Explore more examples
[See the Examples Gallery →](#examples-gallery)

### Configuration

Edit `~/.scriptchat/config.toml` directly. See [`config.toml.example`](config.toml.example) for the full specification.

Key options:
- `default_model` - Model on startup in `provider/model` format (e.g., `ollama/llama3.2`)
- `default_temperature` - Temperature for new conversations (0.0-2.0)
- `system_prompt` - Default system prompt (override with `/prompt`)
- `[[providers]]` - Provider configs with `id`, `type`, `api_url`, `models`

**API Keys:** Set `api_key` in config or use environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).

Minimal example:
```toml
[general]
default_model = "ollama/llama3"

[[providers]]
id = "ollama"
type = "ollama"
api_url = "http://localhost:11434/api"
models = "llama3,phi3"
```

## Usage

### Batch Mode

Run a script file:

```bash
scriptchat --run script.sc
```

Use `--continue-on-error` to run all assertions even if some fail (exit code is still 1 if any fail):

```bash
scriptchat --run tests/prompt-tests.sc --continue-on-error
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--init` | Interactive configuration setup |
| `--run FILE` | Run a script file in batch mode |
| `--continue-on-error` | Don't stop on assertion failures |
| `--version` | Show version |

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success (all assertions passed) |
| `1` | Failure (assertion failed, config error, or runtime error) |

### Commands

All commands start with `/`:

**Conversation**
- `/new` - Start a new conversation
- `/save` - Save the current conversation
- `/load [--archived] [name]` - Load a saved conversation. Use `--archived` to load from archive. Without args, shows interactive selection menu.
- `/branch` - Create a branch (copy) of the current conversation
- `/rename` - Rename a saved conversation (renames its directory)
- `/chats [--archived|--all]` - List saved conversations. Use `--archived` for archived only, `--all` for both.
- `/archive [index|name|range] [--tag key=value]` - Archive conversations by index (`3`), name, range (`1-5`), or tag filter
- `/unarchive [index|name|range] [--tag key=value]` - Restore archived conversations (same syntax as `/archive`)
- `/clear [index]` - Clear and delete the current conversation, or delete a saved conversation by index (requires confirmation)

**Export/Import**
- `/export [format]` - Export the current conversation (formats: `md`, `json`, `html`; prompts if omitted). `json` includes full metadata; `md`/`html` are minimal, human-friendly transcripts.
- `/export-all [format]` - Export all saved conversations in the given format.
- `/import <path>` - Import a conversation exported as `md` or `json` into the conversations folder
- `/import-chatgpt <path> [--dry-run]` - Import conversations from a ChatGPT export ZIP file. Use `--dry-run` to preview without saving.

**Model & Settings**
- `/model [provider/name]` - Switch model. Without args, shows interactive selection menu. With args, switches directly (e.g., `/model ollama/llama3`).
- `/temp` - Change the temperature setting
- `/reason [level]` - Set reasoning level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`). Without args, shows interactive selection menu. For Anthropic Claude, these map to thinking budgets (4K, 16K, 32K, 55K tokens).
- `/thinking [tokens]` - Set exact thinking budget in tokens for Anthropic Claude (1024-128000). Use `/thinking off` to disable. Overrides `/reason` presets.
- `/timeout <seconds|0|off>` - Set the request timeout in seconds, or disable with `0` or `off`
- `/stream [on|off]` - Toggle or set streaming of assistant responses
- `/prompt [text|clear]` - Set or clear the system prompt for this conversation (prompts if omitted)

**Files**
- `/file [--force] <path>` - Register a file for use as `@path` in messages (content is expanded when sending, message stores `@path`). Use `--force` for large files above `file_confirm_threshold_bytes`.
- `/files [--long]` - List registered files (with sizes and hashes when using `--long`)

**Tags**
- `/tag key=value` - Apply metadata tags to the conversation (shown in `/chats` and `/load`)
- `/untag <key>` - Remove a metadata tag from the conversation
- `/tags` - List tags on the current conversation

**Messaging**
- `/send <message>` - Queue a message (sends immediately if the model is idle)
- `/history [n|all]` - Show recent user messages in current conversation (persists if saved/loaded; default: last 10)
- `/note <text>` - Add a note to the conversation (saved and visible, but not sent to model)
- `/undo [n]` - Remove the last user/assistant exchange(s) from the conversation. Without n, it removes 1.
- `/retry` - Drop the last assistant message and resend the previous user message

**Testing & Debug**
- `/assert <pattern>`, `/assert-not <pattern>` - Assert the last response contains (or doesn't contain) a text/regex pattern. Case-insensitive. Exits with error in batch mode if assertion fails.
- `/echo <text>` - Print a message without sending to model
- `/log-level <level>` - Adjust logging verbosity (debug/info/warn/error/critical)
- `/profile [--full]` - Show current settings and registered files

**Scripting**
- `/run <path>` - Execute a script file (one command/message per line; lines starting with `#` are comments)
- `/sleep <seconds>` - Pause execution for the specified duration (scripts/batch mode only)
- `/set <name>=<value>` - Define a script variable for use with `${name}` syntax
- `/vars` - List all defined variables

**System**
- `/help [command|keyword]` - Show help for all commands, a specific command, or search by keyword.
- `/keys` - Show keyboard shortcuts
- `/exit` - Exit ScriptChat

### Multi-line Messages

To enter a multi-line message:

1. Type `"""` and press Enter
2. Enter your message across multiple lines
3. Type `"""` on a new line to send

This syntax also works in script files (`/run` or `--run`):

```bash
"""
Analyze this code for:
- Security issues
- Performance problems
"""
```

### Script Variables

Use `/set` to define variables that can be referenced with `${name}` syntax:

```bash
/set model=llama3
/model ${model}
/set greeting=Hello, how are you?
${greeting}
```

Variables are expanded in both commands and messages. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

**Environment variable fallback:** If a variable isn't defined via `/set`, ScriptChat checks environment variables. This enables parameterized scripts:

```bash
# Run with different configurations
LANGUAGE=Python TOPIC="error handling" scriptchat --run test.sc
LANGUAGE=Rust TOPIC="memory safety" scriptchat --run test.sc
```

Script variables (`/set`) take precedence over environment variables. Unknown variables are left unexpanded.

**Security:** Sensitive environment variables matching patterns like `*_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_PASSWORD` are blocked from expansion by default. Configure in `config.toml`:

```toml
[general]
# Disable env var expansion entirely
env_expand_from_environment = false

# Or override the default blocklist with your own patterns
env_var_blocklist = ["MY_PRIVATE_*", "INTERNAL_*"]

# Use empty list to allow all env vars (no blocklist)
env_var_blocklist = []
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Up` | Focus conversation pane |
| `Ctrl+Home/End` | Jump to start/end of conversation |
| `Up/Down` | Scroll (conversation) or history (input) |

### File References

`/file [--force] <path>` registers a file for use in messages. Include `@path` in any user message to inline the file contents when sending (the stored message keeps `@path` for readability). Examples:

- Register: `/file docs/plan.md`
- Send with inline file: `Summarize @docs/plan.md and list action items.` (you can also use `@{docs/plan.md}` or `@plan.md` if unique)
- If an `@path` isn’t registered, the send will error and nothing is sent.

You can register multiple files and mix references in one message. `/profile` lists full paths of registered files.

### Conversation Storage

Conversations are stored in `~/.scriptchat/conversations/` (or `conversations_dir` in config) with the following structure:

- Each conversation is a directory: `YYYYMMDDHHMM_modelname_savename/`
- Messages are stored as individual files: `0001_user.txt`, `0002_llm.txt`, etc.
- Metadata is stored in `meta.json`

You can manually edit message files or delete them as needed.

Exports (`/export`) go to the current working directory by default, or to `exports_dir` if configured.

## Example Workflow

1. Start ScriptChat: `scriptchat` or `sc`
2. Chat with the default model
3. Save your conversation: `/save` then enter a name
4. Switch models: `/model` then select a model
5. Continue chatting with the new model
6. Rename or branch to organize: `/rename new-name` or `/branch`
7. Load a previous conversation: `/load`
8. Exit when done: `/exit` or Ctrl+C

## Status Bar

The status bar shows:
- Provider and model (e.g., `ollama/llama3.2`) with optional reasoning level in parentheses
- Token usage (input/output), with optional context usage percentage
- Conversation ID (or `<unsaved>` for new conversations)
- Thinking indicator when the model is processing

Example: `ollama/llama3.2 (high) | 1234 in / 567 out | 1801/8192 (22.0%) | 202511180945_llama32_my-chat`

## Troubleshooting

**"Configuration file not found"**: Create `~/.scriptchat/config.toml` from the example, or run `scriptchat --init`.

**"Ollama is not running"**: Start Ollama with `ollama serve` before using ScriptChat with an Ollama provider.

**Connection errors**: Check that Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) and accessible at the configured URL.

**Model not found**: Make sure the model is pulled in Ollama (`ollama pull modelname`) and configured in `config.toml`.
