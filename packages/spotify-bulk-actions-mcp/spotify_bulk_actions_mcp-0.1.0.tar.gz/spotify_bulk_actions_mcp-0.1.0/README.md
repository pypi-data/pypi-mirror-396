# Spotify Bulk Actions MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for bulk Spotify operations - **batch playlist creation, library exports, and large-scale library management.**

**What makes this different from other Spotify MCPs?**
- **Confidence scoring** - Batch searches return HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence for each match
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Uncertain matches are exported for review, then re-imported
- **Bulk operations** - Handle 500+ songs efficiently with rate limiting built-in
- **Library exports** - Export your complete library data
- **Podcast playlist focused** - Built specifically for importing song lists from podcast show notes

### Playlists Maintained With This MCP
*Coming soon: Switched On Pop, This American Life, and more podcast playlists*

## What This Does

**Library Analysis:**
- Get all your followed artists
- Get all saved/liked songs (handles libraries up to 10k songs)
- Find unique artists from your library ranked by song count
- Find albums where you have 6+ saved songs (great for vinyl shopping!)
- Export your complete library summary

**Bulk Playlist Creation:**
- Import song lists from CSV files (for podcast playlists, etc.)
- Batch search with confidence scoring (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Automatic handling of uncertain matches for human review
- Create playlists from search results

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Spotify account
- Spotify Developer credentials ([get them here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard))

### 2. Clone & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/khglynn/spotify-bulk-actions-mcp.git
cd spotify-bulk-actions-mcp

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy env example and add your credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 3. Authenticate with Spotify (One-Time)

This opens a browser for you to log in:

```bash
python setup_auth.py
```

After login, your token is saved locally in `.spotify_cache/`.

### 4. Test It Works

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "from src.utils.auth import is_authenticated; print('Auth OK!' if is_authenticated() else 'Not authenticated')"
```

### 5. Connect to Claude Code

Add this to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.local.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spotify": {
      "command": "/path/to/spotify-bulk-actions-mcp/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/spotify-bulk-actions-mcp/src/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after adding this.

## Example Workflows

### Get Your Library Stats

Ask Claude:
> "What artists do I have the most saved songs from?"

Claude will use `get_library_artists` and show you.

### Find Albums for Vinyl

Ask Claude:
> "Find albums where I have 6 or more saved songs"

Claude will use `get_albums_by_song_count` with `min_songs=6`.

### Create Playlist from Song List

1. Create a CSV file:
```csv
title,artist
Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen
Hotel California,Eagles
Billie Jean,Michael Jackson
```

2. Ask Claude:
> "Create a playlist called 'My Mix' from this CSV: [paste CSV]"

Claude will:
1. Parse the CSV
2. Search each song with confidence scoring
3. Create the playlist with high-confidence matches
4. Show you uncertain matches to review

### Bulk Podcast Playlist

For large lists (500+ songs):
1. Ask Claude to use `batch_search_tracks` with your song list
2. Review the results (HIGH goes in automatically)
3. Use `export_review_csv` to get uncertain matches
4. Review/correct in a spreadsheet
5. Use `add_reviewed_tracks` to add your corrections

## Rate Limits

The server handles Spotify's rate limits automatically:
- Small delays between API calls
- Automatic retry on 429 errors
- Caching to reduce repeat calls

For 10k songs, expect the initial library fetch to take 2-3 minutes.

## Files & Data

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `.env` | Your Spotify credentials (gitignored) |
| `.spotify_cache/` | Auth tokens and cached data (gitignored) |
| `src/server.py` | Main MCP server |
| `src/tools/` | Tool implementations |

## Troubleshooting

**"Not authenticated" error:**
```bash
python setup_auth.py
```

**Rate limit errors:**
Wait a few minutes and try again. The server will auto-retry.

**Token expired:**
The server auto-refreshes tokens. If issues persist, re-run `setup_auth.py`.

## Security Notes

- Your credentials are in `.env` (gitignored, never committed)
- Auth tokens are stored locally in `.spotify_cache/`
- Never share your `.env` or token files
- If credentials are exposed, rotate them in Spotify Dashboard
