## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-15

### Changed
- Version bump to 1.0.0: First stable release marking production readiness and API stability
- Updated version in `pyproject.toml` and `goedels_poetry/__init__.py` to reflect stable release status

## [0.0.14] - 2025-12-14

### Documentation
- Updated documentation to accurately reflect current codebase state: fixed discrepancies and added missing information across all documentation files
- Updated README.md batch processing description to mention both `.proof` and `.failed-proof` file outputs, matching actual CLI behavior
- Added `max_remote_retries` parameter documentation for all LLM agents (FORMALIZER, PROVER, SEMANTICS, SEARCH_QUERY, DECOMPOSER) in both README.md and CONFIGURATION.md, including in simplified config examples
- Clarified distinction between `max_retries` (formalization attempts, FORMALIZER only) and `max_remote_retries` (network/API retries, all LLM agents) in CONFIGURATION.md
- Updated Makefile test-integration instructions to use `kimina-ast-server` command instead of deprecated `python -m server`, matching README.md
- Enhanced CONFIGURATION.md with complete LM Studio parameter documentation and ensured all provider descriptions are accurate

## [0.0.13] - 2025-12-14

### Added
- Parse failure handling with requeueing and attempt tracking: implemented robust error handling for `LLMParsingError` exceptions across all agents (formalizer, semantics, proof sketcher, prover) with centralized attempt tracking and automatic requeueing in the state manager
- `max_remote_retries` configuration option to LLM settings (`FORMALIZER_AGENT_LLM`, `PROVER_AGENT_LLM`, `SEMANTICS_AGENT_LLM`, `SEARCH_QUERY_AGENT_LLM`, `DECOMPOSER_AGENT_LLM`) for controlling maximum remote API retry attempts
- Proof file extensions based on validation result: proofs are now written to `.proof` files for valid proofs and `.failed-proof` files for invalid proofs, validation exceptions, or non-successful completions
- `proof_validation_result` field in `GoedelsPoetryState` to track final validation status from the Kimina server
- Comprehensive test coverage for parse failure handling functionality (519 lines of new tests)
- `parse_semantic_check_response` function moved to `common.py` for better code organization and Python 3.11 compatibility

### Changed
- Refactored LLM initialization from lazy loading to eager loading, improving performance and error detection
- Updated type hinting in CLI module to use `TYPE_CHECKING` for conditional imports of `GoedelsPoetryStateManager`, improving type checker compatibility without affecting runtime performance
- Enhanced CLI proof file handling logic with refactored `_write_proof_result()` helper function for better maintainability and clarity
- Moved `parse_semantic_check_response` from `kimina_server.py` to `common.py` to avoid kimina_client import dependencies that caused Python 3.11 compatibility issues

### Fixed
- Fixed CI failures on Python 3.11 by avoiding problematic state module import that triggered Pydantic validation errors about using `typing.TypedDict` instead of `typing_extensions.TypedDict`
- Fixed import chain issues in test files by using `patch.dict(sys.modules, ...)` to inject mock modules before imports occur
- Fixed Python 3.11 compatibility issues by eliminating kimina_client import dependencies in semantics agent

### Documentation
- Updated README.md and CONFIGURATION.md to reflect LM Studio integration changes, including updated model references to new GGUF versions and detailed setup instructions for LM Studio

## [0.0.12] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- Updated system architecture diagram to reflect the current architecture.

## [0.0.11] - 2025-12-08

### Added
- LM Studio provider support in the LLM configuration, enabling LM Studio to be used alongside existing Ollama and vLLM providers.

### Changed
- Unified Ollama and vLLM handling by migrating from `ChatOllama` to `ChatOpenAI` for consistent provider integration.
- Updated type hints across the codebase to improve clarity and compatibility.

### Removed
- Support for Google Generative AI decomposer agent: removed Google-specific configuration options (`google_model`, `google_max_output_tokens`, `google_max_self_correction_attempts`) and provider selection logic. The decomposer agent now exclusively uses OpenAI.
- Automatic Ollama model downloading; users now manage model availability explicitly.

### Fixed
- Addressed make check failures to keep automated checks green.

### Documentation
- Expanded README Quick Start instructions for Ollama, vLLM, and LM Studio, clarifying prerequisites and environment configuration.
- Added an architecture diagram to the README to improve the visual overview of the system.

## [0.0.10] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Vector database querying phase: introduces a new phase that queries the Lean Explore vector database to retrieve relevant theorems and lemmas after search query generation and before proof sketching
- VectorDBAgent with factory pattern matching existing agent patterns, using asyncio.run() to wrap async client.search() calls
- APISearchResponseTypedDict TypedDict for type-safe handling of vector database search results
- search_results field in DecomposedFormalTheoremState to store vector database query results
- decomposition_query_queue in GoedelsPoetryState to manage states awaiting vector database queries
- LEAN_EXPLORE_SERVER configuration section in config.ini with url and package_filters options

- Search query generation phase before theorem decomposition: introduces a new phase that generates search queries for vector database retrieval before theorems are decomposed
- SearchQueryAgent with factory pattern matching existing agent patterns
- Two new prompt templates (search-query-initial.md and search-query-backtrack.md) using `<search>` tags for structured parsing
- Template-based backtrack detection that replaces brittle keyword matching with exact prompt template matching
- SEARCH_QUERY_AGENT_LLM configuration section in config.ini
- Comprehensive test coverage (19 new tests) for search query generation functionality
- Theorem hints feature: proof sketcher and backtrack agents now display relevant theorems and lemmas from vector database results to guide proof decomposition
- Prompt logging for LLM agents: added debug logging via `log_llm_prompt()` and `log_llm_response()` functions that output formatted prompts and responses when `GOEDELS_POETRY_DEBUG` environment variable is enabled
- Debug logging for vector database responses when `GOEDELS_POETRY_DEBUG` is enabled
- Expanded proof composition test suite with nested decomposition scenarios

### Changed
- Queue flow updated: decomposition_search_queue → decomposition_query_queue → decomposition_sketch_queue (initial flow)
- Backtracked states now route through search query generation queue to allow intelligent query regeneration based on failure context
- Backtracking now properly removes nodes from decomposition_query_queue when backtracking occurs
- LLM prompt handling: headers are now folded into bodies during preamble splitting, improving consistency and extending splitter test coverage

### Fixed
- Fixed off-by-one errors in self-correction attempt limits that could cause agents to attempt one more correction than configured

## [0.0.9] - 2025-11-23

### Documentation

## [0.0.8] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- Fixed proof reconstruction for unicode have names: broadened `_extract_have_name` to correctly capture Lean identifiers with unicode characters (e.g., h₁ or names using Greek letters) when stitching child proofs back into parent sketches, with regression tests to prevent future issues.

## [0.0.7] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- Hardened `prover_agent` Lean code block parsing by always taking the last block (even when the closing fence is missing) and covering multi-block responses with regression tests to prevent truncated proofs.

### Documentation
- Publishing workflow now explicitly runs `uv lock` to sync `uv.lock` with `pyproject.toml` and reminds maintainers to include both files when committing a release bump.

## [0.0.6] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- Final proof verification for complete assembled proofs: added `check_complete_proof()` function that verifies proofs assembled from multiple subgoals using the Kimina Lean server before they are printed or written to files
- User-friendly progress indicators: added animated progress indicators using Rich's console.status() that display the current framework phase (e.g., "Formalizing theorem", "Proving theorems", "Validating proofs") during execution
- Phase name mapping: added `_PHASE_NAMES` dictionary mapping all 14 framework phase methods to user-friendly descriptions

### Changed
