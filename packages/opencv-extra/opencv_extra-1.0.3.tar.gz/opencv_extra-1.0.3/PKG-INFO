## About <a name = "about"></a>

This package is built as a opencv utilities. Additional algorithms to write text on the image without thinking about the image size. My algorithm will do it own its own.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

pip install opencv-extra

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
```
image = cv.imread("car.jpg", cv.IMREAD_COLOR)
cv.namedWindow("Image", cv.WINDOW_NORMAL)
image = put_text(image, "car", (0, 255, 0), (0, 0), True)
cv.imshow("Image", image)
cv.waitKey(0)
```

#### v1.0.1 - Added draw_label in this version

#### v1.0.2 - Added CaptureRead class in this version

#### v1.0.3 - Added pad_image (with custom padding support) and make_square_image methods for generating square images.

```
from opencv_extra.capture_read_utils import CaptureRead
import cv2 as cv

cap = CaptureRead(path=0, mode="bgr")   # it will show the webcam feed
cap = CaptureRead(path="/path/to/folder", mode="bgr") # it will load all the images from the given folder
cap = CaptureRead(path="/path/to/video_file", mode="bgr") # it will load the video file

cv.namedWindow("image", cv.WINDOW_NORMAL)
for image in cap.next():
    cv.imshow("image", image)
    cv.waitKey(1)
```



### Additional algorithms will be updated regularly, keep in touch with this python package.
