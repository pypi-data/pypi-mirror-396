# *pycommons:* Common Utility Functions for Python Projects.

Some common utility functionality for Python projects.

- [Introduction](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons#introduction)
- [Installation](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons#installation)
- [Examples](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons#examples)
- [License](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons#license)
- [Contact](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons#contact)


## 1. Introduction

In this project, we combine several utilities and functions that are used in our other projects.

These functions have in common that they are fail-fast.
They usually check the types of all of their inputs and raise exceptions immediately if something looks dodgy.
There is no garbage-in/garbage-out:
Our functions raise descriptive errors as soon as they detect something strange.


## 2. Installation

In order to use this package, you need to first install it using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or some other tool that can install packages from [PyPi](https://pypi.org).
You can install the newest version of this library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pycommons/) using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by doing

```shell
pip install pycommons
```

This will install the latest official release of our package as well as [all dependencies](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/requirements_txt.html).
If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released), you can do

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/thomasWeise/pycommons.git
```

If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released) and you have set up a private/public key for GitHub, you can also do:

```shell
git clone ssh://git@github.com/thomasWeise/pycommons
pip install pycommons
```

This may sometimes work better if you are having trouble reaching GitHub via `https` or `http`.

You can also clone the repository and then run a build script, which will automatically install all dependencies, run all the tests, and then install the package on your system, too.
This will work only on Linux, though.
If this build completes successful, you can be sure that [`pycommons`](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons) will work properly on your machine.

All dependencies for using and running `pycommons` are listed at [here](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/requirements_txt.html).


## 3. Examples

### 3.1. Data Structures

```python
from pycommons.ds.cache import str_is_new

cache = str_is_new()
print(cache("1"))
print(cache("2"))
print(cache("1"))
print(cache("3"))
print(cache("2"))
```

prints `True`, `True`, `False`, `True`, and `False`.

```python
from pycommons.ds.immutable_map import immutable_mapping

imap = immutable_mapping({1: 2, 3: 4})
try:
    imap[1] = 3
except TypeError as te:
    print(te)

print(imap[1])
```

prints `'mappingproxy' object does not support item assignment` and `2`.
