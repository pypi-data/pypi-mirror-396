Introduction
------------

django-valkey is a BSD licensed, full featured Valkey cache and session backend
for Django.

this project is a fork of the wonderful `django-redis <https://github.com/jazzband/django-redis>`_ project.
they wrote all the good codes.

Why use django-valkey?

- Valkey is a free licenced and well maintained key/value database
- Uses native valkey-py url notation connection strings
- async support
- Pluggable clients
- Pluggable parsers
- Pluggable serializers
- Primary/secondary support in the default client
- Comprehensive test suite
- Used in production in several projects as cache and session storage
- Supports infinite timeouts
- Facilities for raw access to Valkey client/connection pool
- Highly configurable (can emulate memcached exception behavior, for example)
- Unix sockets supported by default
