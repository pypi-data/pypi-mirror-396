**Charmcraft** is the command-line tool for initializing, packaging, and publishing
charms, the software operators used by Juju. With Charmcraft, you can bypass the
boilerplate steps of crafting a charm and focus on what matters — building scalable,
configurable, and easy-to-deploy applications for Juju.

## Basic usage

Charmcraft provides commands to streamline every step of the charm development process,
from initializing your charm project to releasing it on Charmhub.

In your project's root directory, initialize your charm project with basic template
content by running:

```bash
charmcraft init
```

Once you've configured your project to suit the needs of the application you're
charming, build the charm by running:

```bash
charmcraft pack
```

If you're ready to distribute your charm, you can register its name on Charmhub with:

```bash
charmcraft register
```

Upload your charm and any subsequent revisions to Charmhub with:

```bash
charmcraft upload
```

## Installation

Charmcraft is available on all major Linux distributions and macOS.

The recommended way to install Charmcraft on Linux systems is through its
[snap](https://snapcraft.io/charmcraft).

```bash
sudo snap install charmcraft --classic
```
