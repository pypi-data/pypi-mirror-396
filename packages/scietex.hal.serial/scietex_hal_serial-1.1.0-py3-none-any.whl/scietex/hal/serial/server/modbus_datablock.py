"""
Custom reactive DataBlock for Modbus server.

This module defines a custom reactive sequential payload block for use in a Modbus server.
The primary goal is to provide enhanced functionality, such as triggering callbacks whenever
register values are changed. This allows for better monitoring and reaction to changes
in the server’s state.

Dependencies:
    - pymodbus: Provides base classes and utilities for building Modbus servers and clients.

Classes:
    - ReactiveSequentialDataBlock: Extends the `ModbusSequentialDataBlock` class to implement
      custom behavior upon value changes, such as logging or triggering actions.

Methods:
    - setValues(self, address, values): Overrides the parent class' method to additionally invoke a
      custom callback (`on_change`) when register values are modified.
    - on_change(self, address, values): Callback invoked when register values are changed. Can be
      overridden to perform custom actions, such as logging or event triggering.

This custom payload block enhances the capabilities of the Modbus server by providing flexibility
to react to changes in register values dynamically.

    DataBlock with custom action on value change.

    This class extends the `ModbusSequentialDataBlock` to provide customizable behavior when
    register values are modified. It triggers a callback (`on_change`) whenever values are set,
    allowing for dynamic reactions, such as logging or event triggering.

    Attributes:
        logger (Logger): A logging handler for recording debug, info, warning, and error messages.

    Methods:
        - setValues(self, address, values): Overrides the parent class' method to additionally
          invoke a custom callback (`on_change`) when register values are modified.
        - on_change(self, address, values): Callback invoked when register values are changed.
