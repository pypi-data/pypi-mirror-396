"""
Virtual serial port pair creation.

This module extends the functionality of the `VirtualSerialNetwork` class to specifically handle
the creation of a pair of virtual serial ports. This is useful for simulating bidirectional
communication between two endpoints over a virtual serial link.

Classes:
    - VirtualSerialPair: Specialized subclass of `VirtualSerialNetwork` designed to manage a pair
      of virtual serial ports.

Example:
    >>> vsp = VirtualSerialPair()
    >>> vsp.start()

The `VirtualSerialPair` class simplifies the setup of a virtual serial environment, making it
easier to simulate and test serial communication without requiring physical hardware.

    A virtual serial port pair for simulating serial communication.

    This class inherits from `VirtualSerialNetwork` but is specialized to manage exactly two
    virtual serial ports, representing a bi-directional communication channel. This makes it
    suitable for testing applications that rely on serial communication.

    Attributes:
        serial_ports (list[str]): List of active virtual serial ports. Should always contain
            exactly two ports when the network is initialized correctly.

    Methods:
        start(self, openpty_func=None): Initializes the virtual serial pair. If fewer than two
            ports are successfully created, the network is stopped automatically.
        add(self, external_ports: list[SerialConnectionMinimalConfig]): Disabled for this class
            since adding external ports does not apply to a fixed-pair configuration.
        create(self, ports_num: int): Disabled for this class since additional virtual ports beyond
            the initial pair are not allowed.
        remove(self, remove_list: list[str]): Disabled for this class because removing ports would
            disrupt the pre-configured pair.

    Example:
        >>> vsp = VirtualSerialPair()
        >>> vsp.start()
