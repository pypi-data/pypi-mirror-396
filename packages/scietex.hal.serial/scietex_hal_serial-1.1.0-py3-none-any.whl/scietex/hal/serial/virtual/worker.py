"""
Worker function for serial network creation and management.

This module handles the generation, addition, removal, and payload forwarding for virtual and
physical serial ports. It provides functions to manage a virtual network of serial devices,
ensuring proper handling of incoming commands and payload exchange between connected ports.

Functions:
    - generate_virtual_ports(stack, selector, ports_number, master_files, slave_names,
        worker_io, openpty_func=None):
        Generates a specified number of virtual serial ports using the provided openpty function.
    - add_external_ports(stack, selector, external_ports, master_files, slave_names, worker_io):
        Adds external serial ports to the virtual network.
    - remove_ports(selector, remove_list, master_files, slave_names, worker_io):
        Removes specified ports from the virtual network.
    - forward_data(selector, master_files, loopback=False):
        Forwards payload between connected ports in the virtual network.
    - process_cmd(stack, selector, master_files, slave_names, worker_io, openpty_func=None):
        Processes incoming commands from the worker I/O connection.
    - create_serial_network(worker_io, ports_number=2, external_ports=None,
        loopback=False, openpty_func=pty.openpty):
        Creates a virtual network of serial ports and manages payload flow between them.

Raises:
    Various exceptions may occur during port operations, such as IOErrors or configuration errors.
    The exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, ensuring the stability of the virtual network.

This module enables developers to simulate and test complex serial device interactions without
relying on physical hardware, making it ideal for testing and debugging scenarios.
