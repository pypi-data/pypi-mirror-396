"""
Serial communication helper functions.

This module contains utility functions for calculating common checksums used in serial
communication protocols. Specifically, it provides methods for computing CRC-16/Modbus
checksums and Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC).

Functions:
    - check_sum(payload: bytes) -> int:
        Computes the CRC-16/Modbus checksum for the given payload payload.
    - lrc(payload: bytes) -> int:
        Calculates the Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC) for the given payload payload.
    - check_lrc(message: bytes) -> bool:
        Verifies the correctness of the LRC byte at the end of the message.

Checksum algorithms play a critical role in ensuring payload integrity during serial communications.
CRC-16/Modbus is widely used in industrial protocols like Modbus RTU, while LRC is simpler
but still effective.

This module ensures that checksum calculations adhere to established standards, improving
reliability of serial payload transfers.

def check_sum(payload: bytes) -> int:
    """
    Calculate CRC-16/MODBUS checksum for the payload payload.

    This function computes the CRC-16/Modbus checksum according to the standard algorithm used in
    many industrial communication protocols. The polynomial used is 0xA001, which is typical for
    CRC-16/Modbus.

    Args:
        payload (bytes): Payload payload for which the checksum needs to be calculated.

    Returns:
        int: The computed CRC-16/Modbus checksum.

    Algorithm:
        - Initial value: 0xFFFF
        - XOR each byte with the current checksum value.
        - Shift right by one bit and XOR with 0xA001 if the least significant bit is set.
        - Repeat until all bytes have been processed.

    Notes:
        - This implementation follows the standard CRC-16/Modbus algorithm, widely used
          in protocols like Modbus RTU.
        - The returned checksum is a 16-bit unsigned integer.

def lrc(payload: bytes) -> int:
    """
    Calculate LRC (Longitudinal Redundancy Check) for the payload payload.

    LRC is a simple yet effective checksum mechanism often used in serial communication protocols.
    It calculates the sum of all bytes modulo 256 and then inverts the result.

    Args:
        payload (bytes): Payload payload for which the LRC needs to be calculated.

    Returns:
        int: The computed LRC value.

    Algorithm:
        - Sum all bytes in the payload.
        - Invert the sum using XOR with 0xFF.
        - Increment the inverted sum by 1.
        - Apply a mask of 0xFF to ensure the result fits within one byte.

    Notes:
        - LRC is less computationally intensive compared to CRC,
          but provides weaker error detection.

    Verify the correctness of the LRC byte at the end of the message.

    the LRC is considered valid.

    Returns:
