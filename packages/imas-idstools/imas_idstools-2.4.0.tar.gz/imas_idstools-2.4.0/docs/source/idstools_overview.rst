*IDStools* is a collection of apps for modifying and getting valuable
information from IMAS Interface Data Structures (IDSs). It includes a library
of routines for retrieving relevant data from IDSes. It also offers
readily available various forms of visualizations. These tools were
created in conjunction with scientists and software developers from the
fusion community. The goal of having a common set of functions in the
*IDStools* is to reduce the work of reinventing the wheel by utilizing
accessible functions.

*IDStools* is categorized into three parts

-  Database tools provide data entry related operations
-  IDS tools provides ids manipulation in the data entry
-  Analysis tools provides plasma physics routines and visualization scripts

Advantages:

-  Different tools readily available for daily use of IMAS operations
-  A set of physics functions and libraries, as well as visualization scripts.
-  IDStools is ready reference if you want to develop new routines and contribute
