The Terra Classic Data Analysis Software Development Kit (SDK) not only possesses the functions of a basic SDK but also specifically enhances the on - chain historical data tracing and data analysis functions.

## Features

- **Basic SDK**: Inherit all the LCD query、Tx transaction from the basic SDK and maintain updates.

- **Data Analysis**: Enhanced the on-chain data analysis function, providing aggregation interfaces for historical data tracing and display of pre - processed results.

- **BUG Fixed**: Since validators have the greatest stake in the development of the Terra chain, they actively fix bugs and add features. Currently, the [Binodes](https://validator.info/terra-classic/terravaloper1s2xpff7mj6jpxfyhr7pe25vt8puvgj4wy0tzjx) validator is the main maintainer.


## Recent changes
### V0.2.5 (2025-12-15)
fix(wasm): Improve the message parsing function to support more data types

- Update the `parse_msg` function signature to include the `int` type.
- Use `isinstance` instead of `type` checks to enhance code robustness.
- Add attempts to parse JSON for `str` and `bytes` types.
- Return the original value for strings or bytes that cannot be parsed.
- Add exception handling to catch `ValueError` and `TypeError`.
- For unanticipated data types, directly return the original value instead of raising an exception.

### V0.2.4 (2025-10-21)
Base Terra classic's core v3.6.0 upgrade:

refactor(wasm): Refactor the contract information return structure

- Adjust the return format of contract information, separating the contract address from the contract information.
- Add a new "extension" field in the contract information to support extended information.
- Simplify the field access logic to improve code readability.
- Remove redundant field - handling comments.
- Keep the "code_id" field as a string type instead of parsing it into a number.
- Retain all original fields and maintain their data integrity.

### V0.2.3 (2025-10-16)
feat(bank): Add the function to query the total supply of tokens

- Import the `Coin` class in `bank.py` to support the handling of the amount of a single token.
- Implement the asynchronous method `total_denom` to query the total supply of the specified `denom`.
- Add a synchronous binding wrapper for the `total_denom` method.
- Add a method to query the unclaimed rewards of validators in `distribution.py`
 - Implement both asynchronous and synchronous interfaces for `validator_outstanding_rewards`.
 - Update the relevant API docstrings to reflect the new features.

### V0.2.2 (2025-09-02)
feat(wasm, slashing): add new functionality and update messages

- Add MsgStoreCode_vbeta1 to wasm module
- Update connection data parsing in ibc module
- Add codes and contracts_by_code methods to WasmAPI- Update contract_info method in WasmAPI
- Add MsgUpdateParams to slashing module

### V0.2.1 (2025-08-04)
feat(bank): add denominations metadata endpoint and update related data objects

- Add denoms_metadata method to AsyncBankAPI and BankAPI
- Create Metadata and DenomUnit classes in bank/data.py
- Update TxBody and TxInfo classes to include new fields




## Installation

<sub>**NOTE:** _All code starting with a `$` is meant to run on your terminal (a bash prompt). All code starting with a `>>>` is meant to run in a python interpreter, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipython/">ipython</a>._</sub>

Terra SDK can be installed (preferably in a `virtual environment` from PyPI using `pip`) as follows:

Upgrade the SDK:
```
$ pip install -U terra-classic-data-analysis-sdk
```

<sub>_You might need to run pip via ```python -m pip install -U terra-classic-data-analysis-sdk```. Additionally, you might have `pip3` installed instead of `pip`; proceed according to your own setup._<sub>

# API Reference

An intricate reference to the APIs on the Terra SDK can be found <a href="https://terra-money.github.io/terra.py/index.html">here</a>.

<br/>

# Getting Started

A walk-through of the steps to get started with the Terra SDK alongside a few use case examples are provided below. Alternatively, a tutorial video is also available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfasBlJHKIg">here</a> as reference.

## Requirements

Terra Classic SDK requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python v3.7+</a>.


# Usage Examples

One line of code to query the maximum block height on the current blockchain：

```python
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient

>>> LCDClient().tendermint.block_info()['block']['header']['height']
```

`'1687543'`

Notice：User-defined LCD and CHAIN are still supported, and the usage inherits from the underlying basic SDK capabilities.

### Async Usage

If you want to make asynchronous, non-blocking LCD requests, you can use AsyncLCDClient. The interface is similar to LCDClient, except the module and wallet API functions must be awaited.

```python
>>> import asyncio 
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd import AsyncLCDClient

>>> async def main():
      terra = AsyncLCDClient()
      total_supply = await terra.bank.total()
      print(total_supply)
      await terra.session.close # you must close the session

>>> asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Building and Signing Transactions

If you wish to perform a state-changing operation on the Terra Classic blockchain such as sending tokens, swapping assets, withdrawing rewards, or even invoking functions on smart contracts, you must create a **transaction** and broadcast it to the network.
Terra Classic SDK provides functions that help create StdTx objects.

### Example Using a Wallet (_recommended_)

A `Wallet` allows you to create and sign a transaction in a single step by automatically fetching the latest information from the blockchain (chain ID, account number, sequence).

Use `LCDClient.wallet()` to create a Wallet from any Key instance. The Key provided should correspond to the account you intend to sign the transaction with.

<sub>**NOTE:** *If you are using MacOS and got an exception 'bad key length' from MnemonicKey, please check your python implementation. if `python3 -c "import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)"` returns LibreSSL 2.8.3, you need to reinstall python via pyenv or homebrew.*</sub>

```python
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.key.mnemonic import MnemonicKey

# Fill in the mnemonic phrase of your wallet. A better practice is to set it as a system variable and read it.
>>> key = MnemonicKey(
    mnemonic="sport oppose usual cream task benefit canvas xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

# Init wallet
>>> wallet = LCDClient().wallet(key=key)
```

Once you have your Wallet, you can simply create a StdTx using `Wallet.create_and_sign_tx`.

```python
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.core.bank import MsgSend
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd.api.tx import CreateTxOptions

>>>  tx = wallet.create_and_sign_tx(CreateTxOptions(
        msgs=[MsgSend(
            "terra1drs4gul908c59638gu9s88mugdnujdprjhtu7n", # Sender
            'terra1s2xpff7mj6jpxfyhr7pe25vt8puvgj4wyq8lz4', # Receiver
            "1000000uluna"  # send 1 lunc
        )],
        memo="test transaction!",
        gas_adjustment=1.2,  # Auto fee, can be increased during peak periods.
 
        # fee=Fee(240324,'7023928uluna'),  # Set the fees manually if you need
    ))
```

You should now be able to broadcast your transaction to the network.

```python
>>> result = LCDClient().tx.broadcast(tx)
>>> print(result)
```

<br/>
