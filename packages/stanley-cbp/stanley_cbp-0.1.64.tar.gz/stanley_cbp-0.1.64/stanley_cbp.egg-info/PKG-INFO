# Stanley Pipeline

**Stanley** is a research pipeline for detecting, modeling, and analyzing **eclipsing binaries** and potential **circumbinary planets (CBPs)** in space-based photometric data. It was originally developed for the **Kepler** CBP sample and has since been extended to large-scale searches in **TESS** light curves. In circumbinary systems, planetary transits do **not** occur at regular intervals and transit durations vary significantly due to the orbital motion of both stars around the barycenter. As a result, conventional single-star transit search algorithms perform poorly. **Stanley** implements methods specifically optimized for the **variable-timing and variable-duration** transit signatures unique to circumbinary planets.

## Core Capabilities
### Detrending
- Iterative cosine (COFIAM-like) filtering
- TESS-specific quadratic baseline removal
- Variable-duration biweight filters
- Outlier / flare / kink removal
- Optional ellipsoidal and reflection trend modeling

### Binary Modeling & Validation
- Robust eclipse identification
- Multi-stage BLS period and harmonic validation
- Extraction of binary parameters (P, e, omega, eclipse depths and widths)

### Secondary Eclipse Vetting
- Geometric feasibility tests
- Inclination / eccentricity constraints

### Transit Timing Variation Search
- N-body forward modeling via **REBOUND**
- Variable-duration transit stacking matched to dynamically predicted timing signatures

### Scalable Execution
- Fully HPC-compatible (SLURM)
- Each module (detrending, search, analysis) may run independently or as a unified pipeline
- Interpolative potential for less computational load

## Scientific Context
Stanley was first validated on the **Kepler** circumbinary-planet sample, where it successfully recovered all known CBPs including **Kepler-47 b/c/d**, searched for additional planets using variable-duration stacked transit detection, and demonstrated sensitivity to planets smaller than roughly three Earth radii in about half the systems. The current version extends the pipeline to **TESS**, enabling large-scale searches of low-mass eclipsing binaries and supporting **demographic studies** of small circumbinary planets.

## Repository Structure and Data Requirements

This repository contains only the core **source code** (`stanley_cbp/`).  
All static catalogs needed at runtime are packaged inside:

    stanley_cbp/Databases/

Users do **not** need to download any external data or set a STANLEY_BASE environment variable.

Instead, when running the pipeline (typically from the `Tutorials/` folder), Stanley automatically creates and manages a local runtime workspace containing:

- LightCurves/
- PlanetSearchOutput/
- UserGeneratedData/

These folders are created in the same directory from which the user runs the notebook or script (e.g.,`Tutorials/`), and no manual setup is required.

## Installation
Install from PyPI (future release): pip install stanley_cbp

Or install from a locally built wheel: pip install dist/stanley_cbp-0.1.X-py3-none-any.whl

## Using Stanley in Python

Example workflow:

**Import:**  
from stanley_cbp import runDetrendingModule, Stanley_FindPlanets, runAnalysisModule

**Detrending example:**  
result_det = runDetrendingModule(SystemName="TIC260128333", DetrendingName="DemoDetrend", UseSavedData=0)

**Search example:**  
Stanley_FindPlanets(SearchName="DemoSearch", SystemName="TIC260128333", DetrendingName="DemoDetrend", totalSectors=1, currentSector=1)

**Analysis example:**  
analysis_out = runAnalysisModule(searchName="DemoSearch", systemName="TIC260128333", totalSectors=1)

## Tutorials

A `Tutorials/` directory is provided with example Jupyter notebooks.  
These notebooks assume:

- a local **stanley_cbp** installation,  
- that the directory where the notebook is run will automatically function as the runtime workspace,  
- and that Stanley will generate all required folders (`LightCurves/`, `PlanetSearchOutput/`, `UserGeneratedData/`) as needed.

The tutorials demonstrate detrending, running the CBP search, interpreting outputs, and generating diagnostic figures.
