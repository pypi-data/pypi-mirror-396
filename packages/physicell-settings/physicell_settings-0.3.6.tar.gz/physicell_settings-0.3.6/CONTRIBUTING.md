# Contributing to PhysiCell Configuration Builder

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PhysiCell Configuration Builder! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic knowledge of PhysiCell and XML
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/physicell-config.git
   cd physicell-config
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   python physicell_config/test_config.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run the full test suite
   python physicell_config/test_config.py
   
   # Test specific functionality
   python -c "from physicell_config import PhysiCellConfig; print('Import successful')"
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8** for Python code style
- **Use type hints** where appropriate
- **Document functions** with clear docstrings
- **Keep functions focused** - single responsibility principle

### Example Good Code

```python
def add_substrate(self, name: str, diffusion_coefficient: float = 1000.0,
                 decay_rate: float = 0.1, initial_condition: float = 0.0,
                 units: str = "dimensionless") -> 'PhysiCellConfig':
    """
    Add a substrate to the microenvironment.
    
    Args:
        name: Substrate name
        diffusion_coefficient: Diffusion coefficient (micron^2/min)
        decay_rate: Decay rate (1/min)
        initial_condition: Initial concentration
        units: Concentration units
    
    Returns:
        Self for method chaining
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If substrate name is empty or already exists
    """
    if not name:
        raise ValueError("Substrate name cannot be empty")
    
    if name in self.substrates:
        raise ValueError(f"Substrate '{name}' already exists")
    
    self.substrates[name] = {
        'diffusion_coefficient': float(diffusion_coefficient),
        'decay_rate': float(decay_rate),
        'initial_condition': float(initial_condition),
        'units': str(units)
    }
    return self
```

### Testing

- **Add tests** for all new functionality
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Ensure backward compatibility** when modifying existing features
- **Test with real PhysiCell configurations** when possible

## 🎯 Types of Contributions

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Check existing issues** before creating new ones
- **Provide clear reproduction steps**
- **Include PhysiCell version and configuration details**
- **Test the fix thoroughly**

### ✨ New Features

Before implementing major features:

1. **Open an issue** to discuss the feature
2. **Get feedback** from maintainers and community
3. **Plan the implementation** - API design, testing strategy
4. **Consider backward compatibility**

### 📚 Documentation

- **Improve README examples**
- **Add API documentation**
- **Create tutorials** for complex features
- **Fix typos and clarify instructions**

### 🧪 Testing

- **Add test cases** for untested code
- **Improve test coverage**
- **Add integration tests** with PhysiCell examples
- **Performance testing** for large configurations

## 📋 Contribution Areas

### High Priority

- **More PhysiCell examples** - Reproduce published models
- **Additional cell cycle models** - Support more PhysiCell cycle types
- **ECM support** - Extracellular matrix configuration
- **Performance optimization** - For large configurations
- **Error handling improvements** - Better validation and error messages

### Medium Priority

- **Configuration templates** - Pre-built model templates
- **Parameter validation** - More sophisticated range checking
- **XML pretty-printing** - Better formatted output
- **Configuration comparison tools** - Diff between configs

### Nice to Have

## 📦 Release Process (For Maintainers)

This project uses automated GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deployment to PyPI.

### Creating a New Release

1. **Update version number** in `setup.py`:
   ```python
   version="0.3.5",  # Update to new version
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with release notes

3. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add setup.py CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "Bump version to 0.3.5"
   git push
   ```

4. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.3.5 -m "Release version 0.3.5"
   git push origin v0.3.5
   ```

### Automated Deployment Workflow

When a version tag (e.g., `v0.3.5`) is pushed:

1. **Test Job** - Package is tested on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
2. **Build Job** - Distribution packages (sdist and wheel) are built and validated
3. **Publish Job** - Package is automatically published to PyPI (if all tests pass)

**Note**: The `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret must be configured in the repository settings for deployment to work.

For more details, see [`.github/workflows/README.md`](.github/workflows/README.md).
