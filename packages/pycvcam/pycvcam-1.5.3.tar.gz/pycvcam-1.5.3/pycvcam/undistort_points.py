    Undistort 2D ``image_points`` using the camera intrinsic, distortion transformations to obtain the ``normalized_points`` in the camera coordinate system or ``undistorted_points`` if ``R`` or ``P`` are provided.

    The process to undistort a 2D-image point is as follows:

    1. The ``image_points`` (:math:`\vec{x}_i`) are normalized by applying the inverse intrinsic application to obtain the ``distorted_points`` (:math:`\vec{x}_d`).
    2. The ``distorted_points`` (:math:`\vec{x}_d`) are undistorted by the distortion model using the coefficients :math:`\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \ldots\}` to obtain the ``normalized_points`` (:math:`\vec{x}_n`).
    3. A rectification extrinsic operation R and a new projection intrinsic projection P can be applied to the ``normalized_points`` to return the ``undistorted_points`` in the space required by the user.

    .. note::

        The ``P = intrinsic`` to return the undistorted points in the image coordinate system.
        This allow to create the same camera model but with no distortion.

    .. warning::

        Iterative non-linear optimization is used to find the undistorted points.

    The given points ``image_points`` are assumed to be in the sensor coordinate system and expressed in 2D coordinates with shape (..., 2).
    If the user gives not give a intrinsic transformation, it equivalent to give directly the normalized points.

    .. note::

        The expected ``image_points`` can be extracted from the ``pixel_points`` by swaping the axes.

    .. warning::

        The points are converting to float before applying the inverse transformation.
        See :class:`pycvcam.core.Package` for more details on the default data types used in the package.
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_points : numpy.ndarray
        The 2D image points in the camera normalized coordinate system. Shape (..., 2)
        
    intrinsic : Optional[Intrinsic]
        The intrinsic transformation to be applied to the image points.
        If None, a no intrinsic transformation is applied (i.e., identity transformation).

    distortion : Optional[Distortion]
        The distortion model to be applied to the normalized points.
        If None, a no distortion transformation is applied (i.e., identity transformation).

    R : Optional[Extrinsic], optional
        The rectification extrinsic transformation (rotation and translation) to be applied to the normalized points.
        If None, a no extrinsic transformation is applied (i.e., identity transformation). Default is None.

    P : Optional[Intrinsic], optional
        The projection intrinsic transformation to be applied to the normalized points.
        If None, a no intrinsic transformation is applied (i.e., identity transformation).
        This is useful to return the undistorted points in the image coordinate system.

    transpose : bool, optional
        If True, the input points are assumed to be in the shape (2, ...) instead of (..., 2). Default is False.
        The output points will be in the same shape as the input points.

    _skip : bool, optional
            [INTERNAL USE], If True, skip the checks for the transformation parameters and assume the points are given in the (Npoints, input_dim) float format.
            `transpose` is ignored if this parameter is set to True.
    
    **kwargs : optional
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed. [warning]

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The undistorted 2D image points in the camera coordinate system. Shape (..., 2). If no ``P`` is given, the ``normalized_points`` are returned instead of the ``undistorted_points``.

    Example
    --------
    The following example shows how to undistort 2D image points using the intrinsic camera matrix and a distortion model.

    .. code-block:: python

        import numpy
        from pycvcam import undistort_points, Cv2Distortion, Cv2Intrinsic

        # Define the 2D image points in the camera coordinate system
        image_points = numpy.array([[320.0, 240.0],
                                    [420.0, 440.0],
                                    [520.0, 540.0],
                                    [620.0, 640.0],
                                    [720.0, 740.0]]) # shape (5, 2)

        # Define the intrinsic camera matrix
        K = numpy.array([[1000.0, 0.0, 320.0],
                        [0.0, 1000.0, 240.0],
                        [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]])
    
        # Create the intrinsic object
        intrinsic = Cv2Intrinsic.from_matrix(K)

        # Define the distortion model (optional)
        distortion = Cv2Distortion([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])

        # Undistort the 2D image points
        normalized_points = undistort_points(image_points, intrinsic=intrinsic, distortion=distortion)

    To return the undistorted points in the image coordinate system, you can provide a projection P equal to the intrinsic K:

    .. code-block:: python

        undistorted_points = undistort_points(image_points, intrinsic=intrinsic, distortion=distortion, P=K)
