{{ context_name }} bounded context

A bounded context is an explicit boundary within which a domain model is defined and applicable.
It represents a cohesive subdomain with its own ubiquitous language.

This context contains:
- Domain model (aggregates, entities, value objects, events, repositories)
- Application logic (commands, queries, mediators)
- Infrastructure implementations (repositories, services)
- Presentation layer (CLI commands, web routes)

Context: {{ context_name }}
{% if context_name == 'shared' %}
Description: Shared kernel - common code across contexts (value objects, utilities, shared domain logic)
{% else %}
Description: TODO - Describe the purpose of this bounded context
{% endif %}

Guidelines:
- Keep the domain model pure and framework-independent
- Use domain events to communicate with other contexts (avoid direct dependencies)
- Prefer duplication over coupling between contexts
- Each context should be independently deployable (if needed)
