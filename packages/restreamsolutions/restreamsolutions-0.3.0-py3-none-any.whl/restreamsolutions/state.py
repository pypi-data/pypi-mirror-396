class State(BaseInterface):
    """Represents the current configuration state for a Site (well) on a Pad.

    This model is returned by Pad.get_states()/aget_states() and Site.get_state()/aget_state()
    and describes which stage a site is in right now, together with supporting
    metadata used by state calculation. The class provides synchronous and asynchronous methods for each use case.

    Typical usage examples:
      - Fetch current states for all sites on a pad: Pad.get_states()
      - Fetch the current state for a specific site: Site.get_state()
      - Filter states by stage name pattern via StageNameFilters.

    Attributes (populated from the API):
      - site (dict): Minimal representation of the owning Site.
      - site_component_configuration (dict): Site-level configuration that feeds state calculation.
      - truth_table (dict): Rules and computed data used to derive the current_state.
      - current_state (str): Human-readable current state/stage name.
      - actual_stage_number (int): Actual stage number.
      - completed_stage_number (int): Completed stage number.
      - calculated_stage_number (int): Calculated stage number.
      - site_name (str): Convenience copy of the site name.
      - date_created (datetime): When this State object was first created.
      - last_updated (datetime): When this State object was last updated by the system.
      - last_state_update (datetime): Datetime of the last state transition that affected current_state.
      - truth_table_calculating (bool): Deprecated; kept for backward compatibility.
      - state_change_primary_field_values (dict): The set of primary configuration field values whose changes
        caused the current state change.
      - last_state_update_system_time (datetime): System time of the last state update recorded by the backend.
      - last_state_confirmation_time (datetime): Timestamp of the most recent confirmation of the current state's validity.
      - previous_state (int): ID of the previous stage history object.
