    Represents a data-change event for a specific site within a time interval

    Instances carry the site ID, the affected time window [start_date, end_date],
    the modification type and subtype, and the update_received flag indicating
    whether this change was confirmed by a user after fetching it from the API.

    The class exposes synchronous and asynchronous methods to fetch the
    corresponding data for the interval and to acknowledge the event back to the
    API. After acknowledgment (confirm_data_received), the event will no longer
    appear in API responses, and update_received for the instance will be set to
