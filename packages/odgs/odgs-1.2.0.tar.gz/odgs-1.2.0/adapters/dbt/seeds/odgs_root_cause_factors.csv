ENV_001,Lack of Clear System of Record (SoR),"Critical data elements (e.g., customer information, product specifications, financial master data) exist in multiple systems or locations without a formally designated, single authoritative source. This leads to conflicting versions of the truth across the organization."
ENV_002,Prevalence of 'Excel Hell' / Shadow IT,"Critical business processes, data management, analysis, and reporting rely heavily on uncontrolled spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) or unmanaged departmental applications (e.g., Access databases, niche cloud tools) outside of central IT governance."
ENV_003,Absence or Inconsistent Application of Data Standards,"Lack of agreed-upon definitions, formats, value domains, and business rules for key data elements across the organization. If standards exist, they are not consistently enforced or adopted."
ENV_004,Data Silos Between Departments/Systems,Data is stored and managed within isolated departmental systems or applications that do not effectively integrate or share information with other parts of the organization.
ENV_005,Immature or Informal Data Governance,"Lack of clearly defined roles, responsibilities, policies, standards, and processes for managing the organization's data assets. Data quality is often an afterthought or managed reactively."
ENV_006,Reliance on Legacy Systems,"Core business operations depend on older technology systems that may be difficult to integrate with modern applications, lack flexibility, have poor data structures, or are costly to maintain."
ENV_007,High Degree of Manual Data Processes,"Significant reliance on human intervention for data entry, updates, validation, reconciliation, and movement between systems, rather than automated processes."
ENV_008,Lack of Data-Aware Culture / Low Data Literacy,"A general lack of understanding across the organization about the importance of data quality, how data is created and used, and the impact of poor data. Employees may not have the skills to interpret or use data effectively."
