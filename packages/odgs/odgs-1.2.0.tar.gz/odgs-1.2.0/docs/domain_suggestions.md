# Domain Name Suggestions

To support the next phase of the project ("The $10M Exit"), securing a strong, brandable domain is key.

## Top Recommendations

### 1. The "Protocol" Play
Focus on the standard nature of the project.
*   **odgs.org** (Ideal for open source, non-profit angle)
*   **odgs.io** (Tech/Developer focused)
*   **opengovernance.io** (Broader, descriptive)

### 2. The "Metric" Play
Focus on the "Open Metric" aspect.
*   **openmetric.io** (Very strong, directly competes with "OpenLineage")
*   **metricprovenance.com** (Owns the category you are coining)
*   **trustedmetrics.ai** (Leans into the AI Safety angle)

### 3. The "AI Safety" Play
Focus on the new strategic pivot.
*   **authentic.ai** (If available, matches "Authentic Intelligence")
*   **aisafetyprotocol.com** (Descriptive, SEO friendly)
*   **hallucination.guard** (Playful, specific product feature)

## Strategy
I recommend purchasing **odgs.io** for the technical documentation/repo and **metricprovenance.com** for the marketing/concept site. This separates the "Tool" from the "Philosophy."
