           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
                  must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# **The Open Governance Manifesto**

### **Data is an Asset. Your Definitions are a Liability.**

We have spent the last decade solving the **Storage Problem**. Thanks to Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake, we can now store petabytes of data cheaply and reliably.

But we are still failing at the **Meaning Problem**.

Ask your Data Engineer for "Gross Churn" and you get one number. Ask your Tableau dashboard and you get another. Ask your Finance team and you get a third.  
This is Metric Drift. And in the age of AI, Metric Drift is fatal. If you feed conflicting definitions to an LLM, you don't get "Business Intelligence"—you get confident hallucinations.

## **The Solution: Headless Data Governance**

It is time to decouple the **Definition** (The *What*) from the **Tool** (The *How*).

Authentic Intelligence Labs introduces the Open Data Governance Schema (ODGS).  
ODGS is a vendor-neutral, JSON-based protocol that acts as the API for your business logic.
![headless architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/drsprx7wk/image/upload/v1764513291/headless-architecure_ilnqfx.png)
### **The Protocol: Write Once, Sync Everywhere**

Instead of defining "Revenue" three times (once in dbt, once in Looker, once in Excel), you define it once in ODGS.  
Our Sync Engine then compiles that definition into:

* SQL for your Data Warehouse (Snowflake/Databricks)  
* LookML for Looker  
* DAX for Power BI  
* **Semantic Context for your AI Agents**

# ODGS: The Open Data Governance Standard
> **The Protocol for "AI Safety" and "Algorithmic Accountability".**

## 📢 The Problem: Semantic Hallucinations
When AI agents or LLMs query your database, they guess the meaning of columns. This leads to **Semantic Hallucinations**—where the AI confidently returns the "Net Profit" but calculated it wrong because it didn't know your specific accounting rules.

## 🛡️ The Solution: ODGS
ODGS is a **machine-readable protocol** (JSON Schema) that explicitly defines your business logic. It serves as the "Ground Truth" for both Humans, AI Agents, and Regulators (EU AI Act).

It's not just documentation; it compiles into:
*   **dbt Tests** (for engineering reliability)
*   **Power BI/Tableau** (for BI consistency)
*   **AI Context** (so Copilots don't lie)

### **The Killer Feature: Metric Provenance**

Generative AI is a "Reasoning Engine," not a "Knowledge Base." It is great at syntax, but terrible at facts.  When an executive asks, _"What was our Churn last month?"_, the AI hallucinates because it sees three different "Churn" columns in your warehouse.

ODGS provides **Metric Provenance**. It forces the AI to look up the _human-codified definition_ first. It provides the **Chain of Custody** for your business logic, ensuring that every AI answer can be traced back to a specific, version-controlled definition in your Git repo.

We believe AI is only as good as the rules you give it.

* **Artificial Intelligence** guesses the answer based on probability.  
* **Authentic Intelligence** knows the answer based on codified human expertise.

ODGS captures the *Authentic Intelligence* of your domain experts—the nuances, the exceptions, the business rules—and codifies them into a standard that AI can respect.

### **Join the Revolution**

The Table Format War is over. The Semantic War has just begun.  
Don't build another silo. Build on the Standard.

# ODGS: Open Data Governance Schema
### The Protocol for Algorithmic Accountability

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

**ODGS** is an open standard that decouples **business logic** from **execution engines** (like dbt, Power BI, or Tableau). It serves as the "Ground Truth" for Enterprise AI, ensuring that the context fed to LLMs is mathematically verifiable and consistent with business reality.

> **The Problem:** "Semantic Hallucination." When an AI Agent calculates "Churn Rate", does it use the Marketing definition (Power BI) or the Finance definition (Snowflake)? If it guesses, it hallucinates.
>
> **The Solution:** ODGS defines metrics *once* in a protocol-agnostic schema. It then **compiles** these definitions into the native languages of your tools (SQL, DAX, TMSL, YAML).

## 🛡️ AI Safety & Governance
ODGS is designed for **Algorithmic Accountability**. It provides:
1.  **Provenance**: Every metric has a unique ID and owner, traceable back to the source.
2.  **Consistency**: The AI, the Dashboard, and the Regulatory Report use the *exact same* logic.
3.  **Auditability**: Changes to logic are Git-versioned and mathematically verified before deployment.

## 🚀 The `odgs` CLI
ODGS comes with a developer-first CLI to manage your governance layer.

```bash
# 1. Validate your schema for AI Safety compliance
odgs validate

# 2. Build artifacts for all downstream tools
odgs build
```

```

The **Open Data Governance Schema (ODGS)** is a vendor-neutral JSON protocol that acts as the "API" for your business definitions. By decoupling the **Definition** (The "What") from the **Tool** (The "How"), you achieve Headless Governance.

### How it works

```json
// example: standard_metrics.json
{
  "metric_id": "KPI_102",
  "name": "Gross_Margin",
  "domain": "Finance",
  "calculation_logic": {
    "abstract": "Revenue - COGS",
    "sql_standard": "SUM(gross_sales) - SUM(cost_of_goods)",
    "dax_pattern": "[Total Sales] - [Total Cost]"
  },
  "owner": "CFO_Office",
  "quality_threshold": "99.5%"
}
```

## 📂 The Protocol Structure

This repository contains the core schemas that define the "Alphabet" of Data Governance:

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`standard_metrics.json`** | The "Golden Record" for KPIs. Define logic, ownership, and sensitivity here. |
| **`standard_dq_dimensions.json`** | The 60 industry-standard dimensions of data quality (Accuracy, Timeliness, Completeness, etc.). |
| **`standard_data_rules.json`** | Technical validation rules (Regex patterns, null checks, referential integrity). |
| **`root_cause_factors.json`** | A standardized taxonomy for *why* data breaks (e.g., `Process_Gap` vs `Integration_Failure`). |
| **`business_process_maps.json`** | Maps how data entities flow through the business lifecycle. |
| **`physical_data_map.json`** | Maps abstract metrics to physical database tables/columns. |
| **`ontology_graph.json`** | Defines relationships between business entities. |

## ✅ Validation & CI/CD Integration

The repository includes a **validator script** that enforces the governance schema:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_schema.py
```

**Output:**
```
🔍 Running Open Governance Schema Validator...
✅ Loaded 72 metrics.
✅ Loaded 50 data rules.
🎉 All Governance Checks Passed!
```

### CI/CD Integration

Add this to your GitHub Actions workflow to enforce governance standards:

```yaml
- name: Validate Governance Schema
  run: python3 scripts/validate_schema.py
```

This ensures that all metrics and rules have:
- Unique IDs
- Assigned owners
- Defined domains
- Clear calculation logic

---

## 📦 Installation

### NPM (Node.js)

```bash
npm install odgs
```

Usage:
```javascript
import { standardMetrics } from 'odgs';
// or
const { standardMetrics } = require('odgs');
```

### PyPI (Python)

### PyPI (Python)

```bash
pip install "odgs[all]"
```

Usage:
```bash
# Initialize a new project
odgs init my_governance_layer

# Add a new metric
cd my_governance_layer
odgs add metric

# Validate schema
odgs validate

# Build artifacts
odgs build
```

## 🛠 Usage & Implementation

## 🔌 BI Adapters

The repository includes built-in adapters to generate configuration files for major BI tools:

| Tool | Output Format | Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **dbt MetricFlow** | `semantic_models.yml` | `adapters/dbt/generate_semantic_models.py` |
| **Power BI** | `measures.tmsl.json` (TMSL) | `adapters/powerbi/generate_tmsl.py` |
| **Tableau** | `metrics.tds` (XML) | `adapters/tableau/generate_tds.py` |

### Generating Adapters

Run the following commands to generate the configurations:

```bash
# Generate dbt MetricFlow YAML
python3 adapters/dbt/generate_semantic_models.py

# Generate Power BI TMSL
python3 adapters/powerbi/generate_tmsl.py

# Generate Tableau TDS
python3 adapters/tableau/generate_tds.py
```

The generated files will be located in the `adapters/<tool>/` directories.

**What is generated?**
*   **Metrics**: Calculation logic (SQL/DAX) for all 72 standard metrics.
*   **Reference Data**: Static tables for DQ Dimensions, Root Causes, and Business Processes.
*   **Data Rules**:
    *   **dbt**: Generic tests (`macros/odgs_tests.sql`) derived from standard rules.
    *   **Power BI/Tableau**: Reference tables to join against.

### Option B: The Reference Implementation

If you prefer a managed "Headless Governance" layer that natively supports ODGS and handles the sync to Power BI/dbt automatically, feel free to see the art of possible with these end-state applications built with the same data:

*   **[Chartr](https://chartr.quirkyswirl.com/)** (React v2)

These examples demonstrate the end outcome for the business user of what the Open Data Governance Schema can do.
