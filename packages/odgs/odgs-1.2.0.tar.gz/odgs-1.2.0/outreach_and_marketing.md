# Outreach & Marketing Strategy: The Road to €10M

This document outlines the tactical steps to validate ODGS with academic partners, secure pilot customers in The Hague, and build a global developer community.

---

## 🏛️ Phase 1: Academic & Research Validation (The "Trust" Layer)
**Goal:** Establish ODGS as a scientifically backed standard for AI Safety.

### 1. TU Delft (The Hague/Delft)
*   **Target Department:** **Values, Technology & Innovation (VTI)**.
    *   *Why:* They focus on "Responsible Innovation" and "AI Safety."
    *   *Contact:* **Innovation & Impact Centre** (Ask for AI & Cybersecurity collaboration).
*   **Student Initiative:** **Delft AI Safety Initiative (DAISI)**.
    *   *Action:* Reach out to DAISI leadership. Propose ODGS as a "Practical Tool for AI Safety" for student projects.
*   **Research Labs:** **AISyLab** (AI & Security).
    *   *Pitch:* "We have the protocol to prevent Semantic Hallucinations. Can we test it in your lab?"

### 2. TNO (The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research)
*   **Program:** **Appl.AI** (Directed by Freek Bomhof).
*   **Initiative:** **"Responsible AI That Works"**.
*   **Pitch:** TNO is looking for *practical* implementations of ethical AI. ODGS is that implementation.

### 3. Grants (NWO & AiNed)
*   **Opportunity:** **AiNed Fellowship Grants** or **Open Mind 2025**.
*   **Angle:** "Bridging the gap between EU AI Act regulation and Technical Implementation."

## 🏢 Phase 2: Corporate Pilots (The "Revenue" Layer)
**Goal:** Find "Design Partners" who are terrified of the EU AI Act.

### 1. The Hague Security Delta (HSD)
*   **Action:** Join HSD as a partner.
*   **Target:** **Zuid-Holland AI** alliance members.
*   **Value Prop:** "The EU AI Act is coming in 2025. Your data isn't ready. ODGS fixes the 'Data Quality' requirement of the Act."

### 2. The "Unprepared" Enterprise
*   **Insight:** 56% of Dutch companies are unprepared for the AI Act.
*   **Sectors:**
    *   **Financial Services:** ING, NN Group, Aegon (All have HQ/Presence in The Hague/Randstad).
    *   **Government:** Ministries in The Hague (Interior, Justice).
*   **Pitch:** "Don't hire 50 lawyers. Install ODGS."

## 📢 Phase 3: Social Media Marketing (The "Hype" Layer)

### 👔 LinkedIn Strategy: "The Thought Leader"
*   **Persona:** The "Chief AI Safety Officer."
*   **Content Pillars:**
    1.  **Fear/Urgency:** "The EU AI Act is here. Your data stack is illegal." (Link to ODGS).
    2.  **Education:** "How to prevent AI Hallucinations using JSON schemas." (Carousel).
    3.  **Validation:** "Partnering with TU Delft to solve Algorithmic Accountability."
*   **Tactic:** Comment on every post by **Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP)** and **European AI Office**.

### 🐦 Twitter/X Strategy: "The Builder"
*   **Persona:** The "Open Source Hacker."
*   **Content Pillars:**
    1.  **Build in Public:** "Just shipped the `odgs` CLI. It compiles JSON to Power BI TMSL. 🤯 #DataEngineering #OpenSource"
    2.  **The "Swiss Army Knife":** "Did you know `standard_metrics.json` can generate dbt tests AND Tableau folders? One file to rule them all."
    3.  **Rants:** "Why is 'Governance' so boring? It should be code."
*   **Hashtags:** `#DataEngineering`, `#AI`, `#OpenSource`, `#TechTwitter`.

## 🗓️ Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Email TU Delft VTI:** "Subject: Research Collaboration on Algorithmic Accountability Protocol."
2.  **Join HSD:** Apply for partnership/membership.
3.  **LinkedIn Post:** Announce the "AI Safety Pivot" and the new `explainer.md`.
