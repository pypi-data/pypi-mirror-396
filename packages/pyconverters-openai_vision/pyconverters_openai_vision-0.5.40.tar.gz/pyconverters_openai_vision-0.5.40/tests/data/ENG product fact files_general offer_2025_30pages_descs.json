The gymnast is wearing a sparkling, intricately designed costume that is predominantly pink and adorned with sequins and embellishments. The outfit has a fitted bodice and a flowing skirt, enhancing the elegance of the movement. \n> \n> Instead of a head, there is a large, shiny pink ball positioned where the head would typically be, creating a surreal effect. The gymnast's arms are gracefully extended, and one leg is lifted, emphasizing the athleticism and artistry of the routine.
