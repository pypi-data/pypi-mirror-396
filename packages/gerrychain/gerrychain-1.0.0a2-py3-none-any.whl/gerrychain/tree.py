"""
This module provides tools and algorithms for manipulating and analyzing graphs,
particularly focused on partitioning graphs based on population data. It leverages the
NetworkX library to handle graph structures and implements various algorithms for graph
partitioning and tree traversal.

Key functionalities include:

- Predecessor and successor functions for graph traversal using breadth-first search.
- Implementation of random and uniform spanning trees for graph partitioning.
- The `PopulatedGraph` class, which represents a graph with additional population data,
  and methods for assessing and modifying this data.
- Functions for finding balanced edge cuts in a populated graph, either through
  contraction or memoization techniques.
- A suite of functions (`bipartition_tree`, `recursive_tree_part`, `_get_seed_chunks`, etc.)
  for partitioning graphs into balanced subsets based on population targets and tolerances.
- Utility functions like `get_max_prime_factor_less_than` and `_recursive_seed_part_inner`
  to assist in complex partitioning tasks.

Dependencies:

- networkx: Used for graph data structure and algorithms.
- random: Provides random number generation for probabilistic approaches.
- typing: Used for type hints.

Last Updated: 25 April 2024

frm:  This file, tree.py, needed to be modified to operate on new Graph
      objects instead of NetworkX Graph objects because the routines are
      used by the Graph objects inside a Partion, which will soon be based
      on RustworkX.  More specifically, these routines are used by Proposals,
      and we will soon switch to having the underlying Graph object used
      in Partitions and Proposals be based on RustworkX.

      It may be the case that they are ONLY ever used by Proposals and
      hence could just have been rewritten to operate on RustworkX Graph
      objects, but there seemed to be no harm in having them work either
      way.  It was also a good proving ground for testing whether the new
      Graph object could behave like a NetworkX Graph object (in terms of
      attribute access and syntax).

frm: RX Documentation

Many of the functions in this file operate on subgraphs which are different from
NX subgraphs because the node_ids change in the subgraph.  To deal with this,
in graph.py we have a _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map data member for Graph objects which maps
the node_ids in a subgraph to the corresponding node_id in its parent graph.  This
will allow routines operating on subgraphs to return results using the node_ids
of the parent graph.

Note that for top-level graphs, we still define this _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map, but in
this case it is an identity map that just maps each node_id to itself.  This allows
code to always translate correctly, even if operating on a top-level graph.

As a matter of coding convention, all calls to graph.subgraph() have been placed
in the actual parameter list of function calls.  This limits the scope of the
subgraph node_ids to the called function - eliminating the risk of those node_ids
leaking into surrounding code.  Stated differently, this eliminates the cognitive
load of trying to remember whether a node_id is a parent or a subgraph node_id.

    frm: Compute the nodes in a subtree defined by a Cut.

    This routine computes the set of nodes in a subtree rooted in the
    node identified by "start" in the tree defined by "succ".

    As such it is highly dependent on context and is not generally
    useful.  That is, it is essentially just a way to refactor some
    code used in a couple of places so that the logic in the code is
    in one place instead of several.

    To be specific, Cuts are always relative to a specific tree for
    a partition.  This tree is a "spanning tree" that converts the
    graph into a DAG.  Cuts are then computed by finding subtrees
    of that DAG that have the appropriate population (this could
    presumably be modified to include other factors).

    When a Cut is created, we want to collect all of the nodes that
    are in the subtree, and this is what this routine does.  It
    merely starts at the root of the subtree (start) and goes down
    the subtree, adding each node to a set.

    frm: ???: confused...

    This function seems to be used for two very different purposes, depending on the
    value of the parameter, one_sided_cut.  When true, the code looks for lots of cuts
    that would create a district with the right population - both above and below the
    node being considered.  Given that it is operating on a tree, one would assume that
    there is only one (or perhaps two if one node's population was tiny) cut for the top
    of the tree, but there should be many for the bottom of the tree.

    However, if the paramter is set to false (the default), then the code checks to see
    whether a cut would produce two districts - on above and one below the tree that
    have the right populations.  In this case, the code is presumatly looking for the
    single node (again there might be two if one node's population was way below epsilon)
    that would bisect the graph into two districts with a tolerable population.

    If I am correct, then there is an opportunity to clarify these two uses - perhaps
    with wrapper functions.  I am also a bit surprised that snippets of code are repeated.
    Again - this causes mental load for the reader, and it is an opportunity for bugs to
    creep in later (you fix it in one place but not the other).  Not sure this "clarification"

# Users do sometimes write custom spanning tree and cut edge functions. My

# appropriate graph and partition object at initialization. We always expect
# the workflow to be something like
#
#     Graph -> Partition -> MarkovChain

    This is like :func:`bipartition_tree` except it chooses a random balanced
    cut, rather than the first cut it finds.

    This function finds a balanced 2 partition of a graph by drawing a
    spanning tree and finding an edge to cut that leaves at most an epsilon
    imbalance between the populations of the parts. If a root fails, new roots
    are tried until node_repeats in which case a new tree is drawn.

    Builds up a connected subgraph with a connected complement whose population
    is ``epsilon * pop_target`` away from ``pop_target``.

    :type graph: Graph
    :param pop_col: The node attribute holding the population of each node.

        ``pop_target``) for the subgraph's population.
    :type epsilon: float

        of root to use before drawing a new spanning tree. Defaults to 1.
    :type node_repeats: int
    :param repeat_until_valid: Determines whether to keep drawing spanning trees
        until a tree with a balanced cut is found. If `True`, a set of nodes will
        always be returned; if `False`, `None` will be returned if a valid spanning
        tree is not found on the first try. Defaults to True.

        algorithm chooses a new root and for testing). Defaults to None.

        :func:`find_balanced_edge_cuts_memoization`.
    :type balance_edge_fn: Callable, optional
    :param one_sided_cut: Passed to the ``balance_edge_fn``. Determines whether or not we are
        cutting off a single district when partitioning the tree. When
        set to False, we check if the node we are cutting and the remaining graph
        are both within epsilon of the ideal population. When set to True, we only
        check if the node we are cutting is within epsilon of the ideal population.
        Defaults to False.
    :type one_sided_cut: bool, optional
    :param choice: The random choice function. Can be substituted for testing. Defaults
        to :func:`random.choice`.

    Inner function for recursive_seed_part.
    Returns a partition with ``num_dists`` districts balanced within ``epsilon`` of
    ``pop_target``.

    frm: TODO: Documentation:     Correct the above statement that this function returns a
                        partition. In fact, it returns a list of sets of nodes, which is
                        conceptually equivalent to a partition, but is not a Partition object.
                        Each set of nodes constitutes a district, but the district does not
                        have an ID, and there is nothing that associates these nodes
                        with a specific graph - that is implicit, depending on the graph
                        object passed in, so the caller is responsible for knowing that
                        the returned list of sets belongs to the graph passed in...

    Splits graph into num_chunks chunks, and then recursively splits each chunk into
    ``num_dists``/num_chunks chunks.
    The number num_chunks of chunks is chosen based on ``n`` and ``ceil`` as follows:

    - If ``n`` is None, and ``ceil`` is None, num_chunks is the largest prime factor
      of ``num_dists``.
    - If ``n`` is None and ``ceil`` is an integer at least 2, then num_chunks is the
      largest prime factor of ``num_dists`` that is less than ``ceil``
    - If ``n`` is a positive integer, num_chunks equals n.

    Finally, if the number of chunks as chosen above does not divide ``num_dists``, then
    this function bites off a single district from the graph and recursively partitions
    the remaining graph into ``num_dists - 1`` districts.

    frm: ???:   OK, but why is the logic above for num_chunks the correct number?  Is there
                a mathematical reason for it?  I assume so, but that explanation is missing...

                I presume that the reason is that something in the code that finds a
                district scales exponentially, so it makes sense to divide and conquer.
                Even so, why this particular strategy for divide and conquer?
