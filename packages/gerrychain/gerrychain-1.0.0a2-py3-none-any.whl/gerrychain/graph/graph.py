"""
This module provides tools for working with graphs in the context of geographic data.
It extends the functionality of the NetworkX library, adding support for spatial data structures,
geographic projections, and serialization to and from JSON format.

This module is designed to be used in conjunction with geopandas, shapely, and pandas libraries,
facilitating the integration of graph-based algorithms with geographic information systems (GIS).

Note:
This module relies on NetworkX, pandas, and geopandas, which should be installed and
imported as required.

    frm: this class encapsulates / hides the underlying graph which can either be a
    NetworkX graph or a RustworkX graph.  The intent is that it provides the same
    external interface as a NetworkX graph (for all of the uses that GerryChain cares
    about, at least) so that legacy code that operated on NetworkX based Graph objects
    can continue to work unchanged.

    When a graph is added to a partition, however, the NX graph will be converted into
    an RX graph and the NX graph will become unaccessible to the user.  The RX graph
    may also be "frozen" the way the NX graph was "frozen" in the legacy code, but we
    have not yet gotten that far in the implementation.

    It is not clear whether the code that does the heavy lifting on partitions will
    need to use the old NX syntax or whether it will be useful to allow unfettered
    access to the RX graph so that RX code can be used in these modules.  TBD...

        Create a :class:`Graph` from a RustworkX.PyGraph object

        There are three primary use cases for this routine:
        1) converting an NX-based Graph to be an RX-based
        Graph, 2) creating a subgraph of an RX-based Graph, and
        3) creating a Graph whose node_ids do not need to be
        mapped to some previous graph's node_ids.

        In a little more detail:

        1) A typical way to use GerryChain is to create a graph
        using NetworkX functionality and to then rely on the
        initialization code in the Partition class to create
        an RX-based Graph object.  That initialization code
        constructs a RustworkX PyGraph and then uses this
        routine to create an RX-based Graph object, and it then
        creates maps from the node_ids of the resulting RX-based
        Graph back to the original NetworkX.Graph's node_ids.

        2) When creating a subgraph of a RustworkX PyGraph
        object, the node_ids of the subgraph are (in general)
        different from those of the parent graph.  So we
        create a mapping from the subgraph's node_ids to the
        node_ids of the parent.  The subgraph() routine
        creates a RustworkX PyGraph subgraph, then uses this
        routine to create an RX-based Graph using that subgraph,
        and it then creates the mapping of subgraph node_ids
        to the parent (RX) graph's node_ids.

        3) In those cases where no node_id mapping is needed
        this routine provides a simple way to create an
        RX-based GerryChain graph object.

        # the node data for the nodes in RX graphs do not have to be
        # a data dictionary - they can be any Python object.  Since
        # gerrychain code depends on having a data dictionary
        # associated with nodes and edges, we need to check the RX

        This routine still exists because there is a lot of legacy
        code that uses this syntax to iterate through all of the nodes
        in a graph.

        There is another routine, node_indices(), which does essentially
        the same thing (it returns a set of node_ids, however, rather than
        a list).

        Why have two routines that do the same thing?  The answer is that with
        move to RX, it seemed appropriate to emphasize the distinction
        between objects and the IDs for objects, hence the introduction of
        node_indices() and edge_indices() routines.  This distinction is
        critical for edges, but mostly not important for nodes.  In fact
        this routine is implemented by just converting node_indices to a list.
        So, it is essentially a style issue - when referring to nodes, we
        are almost always really referring to node_ids, so why not use a
        routine called node_indices()?

        Note that there is a subtle point to be made about node names vs.
        node_ids.  It was common before the transition to RX to create
        nodes with IDs that were essentially names.  That is, the ID had
        semantic weight.  This is not true with RX node_ids.  So, any
        code that relies on the semantics of a node's ID (treating it
        like a name) is suspect in the new RX world.

        This is a HUGE difference from the NX world where the

        frm: RX Documentation:

        Subgraphs are one of the biggest differences between NX and RX, because RX creates new
        node_ids for the nodes in the subgraph, starting at 0.  So, if you create a subgraph with
        a list of nodes: [45, 46, 47] the nodes in the subgraph will be [0, 1, 2].

        This creates problems for functions that operate on subgraphs and want to return results
        involving node_ids to the caller.  To solve this, we define a
        _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map whenever we create a subgraph that will provide the node_id
        in the parent for each node in the subgraph. For NX this is a no-op, and the
        _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map is just an identity map - each node_id is
        mapped to itself.  For RX, however, we store the parent_node_id in the node's data before
        creating the subgraph, and then in the subgraph, we use the parent's node_id to construct
        a map from the subgraph node_id to the parent_node_id.

        This means that any function that wants to return results involving node_ids can safely
        just translate node_ids using the _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map, so that the results make
        sense in the caller's context.

        A note of caution: if the caller retains the subgraph after using it in a function call,
        the caller should almost certainly not use the node_ids in the subgraph for ANYTHING.
        It would be safest to reset the value of the subgraph to None after using it as an
        argument to a function call.

        Also, for both RX and NX, we set the _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map to be the identity map
        for top-level graphs on the off chance that there is a function that takes both top-level
        graphs and subgraphs as a parameter.  This allows the function to just always do the node
        translation. In the case of a top-level graph the translation will be a no-op, but it will
        be correct.

        Also, we set the _is_a_subgraph = True, so that we can detect whether a parameter passed
        into a function is a top-level graph or not.  This will allow us to debug the code to
        determine if assumptions about a parameter always being a subgraph is accurate.  It also
        helps to educate future readers of the code that subgraphs are "interesting"...

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : RustworkX.PyGraph object (not a NetworkX graph)

        source : node
            Starting node for the breadth-first search; this function

            this node.

        neighbors : function
            A function that takes a newly visited node of the graph as input
            and returns an *iterator* (not just a list) of nodes that are
            neighbors of that node with custom ordering. If not specified, this is
            just the ``G.neighbors`` method, but in general it can be any function
            that returns an iterator over some or all of the neighbors of a
            given node, in any order.

        depth_limit : int, optional(default=len(G))
            Specify the maximum search depth.

        Yields
        ------
        edge
            Edges in the breadth-first search starting from `source`.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(7)
        >>> list(nx.generic_bfs_edges(G, source=0))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]

        >>> list(nx.generic_bfs_edges(G, source=2, depth_limit=2))
        [(2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 0), (3, 4)]

        The `neighbors` param can be used to specify the visitation order of each
        node's neighbors generically. In the following example, we modify the default
        neighbor to return *odd* nodes first:

        >>> def odd_first(n):
        ...     return sorted(G.neighbors(n), key=lambda x: x % 2, reverse=True)

        >>> G = nx.star_graph(5)

        frm: It took me a while to grok what predecessors() and successors()
        were all about.  In the end, it was simple - they are just the
        parents and the children of a tree that "starts" at the given root
        node.

        What took me a while to understand is that this effectively
        converts an undirected cyclic graph into a DAG.  What is clever is
        that as soon as it detects a cycle it stops traversing the graph.
        The other thing that is clever is that the DAG that is created
        either starts at the top or the bottom.  For successors(), the
        DAG starts at the top, so that the argument to successors() is
        the root of the tree.  However, in the case of predecessors()
        the argument to predecessors() is a leaf node, and the "tree"
        can have multiple "roots".

        In both cases, you can ask what the associated parent or
        children are of any node in the graph.  If you ask for the
        successors() you will get a list of the children nodes.
        If you ask for the predecessors() you will get the single
        parent node.

        I think that the successors() graph is deterministic (except
        for the order of the child nodes), meaning that for a given
        graph no matter what order you created nodes and added edges,
        you will get the same set of children for a given node.
        However, for predecessors(), there are many different
        DAGs that might be created depending on which edge the
        algorithm decides is the single parent.

        All of this is interesting, but I have not yet spent the
        time to figure out why it matters in the code.

        TODO: Code: predecessors(): Decide if it makes sense to have different implementations
              for NX and RX.  The code below has the original definition
              from the pre-RX codebase, but the code for RX will work
              for NX too - so I think that there is no good reason to
              have different code for NX. Maybe no harm, but on the other
              hand, it seems like a needless difference and hence more
              complexity...

        TODO: Performance: see if the performance of the built-in NX
              version is significantly better than the generic one.
