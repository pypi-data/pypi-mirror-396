# frm: TODO: Performance: Think about the efficiency of the routines in this module.  Almost all
#               of these involve traversing the entire graph, and I fear that callers
#               might make multiple calls.
#
#               Possible solutions are to 1) speed up these routines somehow and 2) cache
#               results so that at least we don't do the traversals over and over.

# frm: TODO: Refactoring: Rethink WTF this module is all about.
#
# It seems like a grab bag for lots of different things - used in different places.
#
# What got me to write this comment was looking at the signature for def contiguous()
# which operates on a partition, but lots of other routines here operate on graphs or
# other things.  So, what is going on?
#
# Peter replied to this comment in a pull request:
#
#     So anything that is prefixed with an underscore in here should be a helper
#     function and not a part of the public API. It looks like, other than
#     is_connected_bfs (which should probably be marked "private" with an
#     underscore) everything here is acting like an updater.

def _are_reachable(

) -> bool:
    """
    A modified version of NetworkX's function
    `networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted._dijkstra_multisource()`

    This function checks if the targets are reachable from the start_node node
    while avoiding edges based on the avoid condition function.

    :param graph: Graph
    :type graph: Graph
    :param start_node: The starting node
    :type start_node: int
    :param avoid: The function that determines if an edge should be avoided.
        It should take in three parameters: the start node, the end node, and
        the edges to avoid. It should return True if the edge should be avoided,
        False otherwise.
        # frm: TODO: Documentation:  Fix the comment above about the "avoid" function parameter.
        #               It may have once been accurate, but the original code below
        #               passed parameters to it of (node_id, neighbor_node_id, edge_data_dict)
        #               from NetworkX.Graph._succ  So, "the edges to avoid" above is wrong.
        #               This whole issue is moot, however, since the only routine
        #               that is used as an avoid function ignores the third parameter.
        #               Or rather it used to avoid the third parameter, but it has
        #               been updated to only take two parameters, and the code below
        #               has been modified to use Graph.neighbors() instead of _succ
        #               because 1) we can't use NX and 2) because we don't need the
        #               edge data dictionary anyways...
