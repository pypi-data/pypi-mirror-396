"""
This module provides a Grid class used for creating and manipulating grid partitions.
It's part of the GerryChain suite, designed to facilitate experiments with redistricting
plans without the need for extensive data processing. This module relies on NetworkX for
graph operations and integrates with GerryChain's Partition class.

Dependencies:

- math: For math.floor() function.
- networkx: For graph operations with using the graph structure in
    :class:`~gerrychain.graph.Graph`.
- typing: Used for type hints.

    The :class:`Grid` class represents a grid partitioned into districts.

    any data processing or cleaning to get started.

    Example usage::

    The nodes of ``grid.graph`` are labelled by tuples ``(i,j)``, for ``0 <= i <= 10``
    and ``0 <= j <= 10``. Each node has an ``area`` of 1 and each edge has ``shared_perim`` 1.
