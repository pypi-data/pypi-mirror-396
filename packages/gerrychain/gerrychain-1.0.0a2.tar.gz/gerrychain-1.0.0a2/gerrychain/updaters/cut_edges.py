    frm: TODO: Documentation  This description should be updated.  Cut_edges are edges that touch
                two different parts (districts).  They are the internal boundaries
                between parts (districts).  This routine finds all of the cut_edges
                in the graph and then creates a dict that stores all of the cut_edges
                for each part (district).  This dict becomes the value of
                partition["cut_edges"].

                Peter agreed:
                    Ah, you are correct. It maps parts to cut edges, not just any edges in the
                    partition
