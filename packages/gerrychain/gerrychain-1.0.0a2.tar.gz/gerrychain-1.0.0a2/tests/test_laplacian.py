"""
This tests whether we compute the same laplacian matrix for NX and RX
based Graph objects.

The NX version is computed (as was true in the old code) by a built-in
NetworkX routine.  The RX version is computed by code added when we
supported RX as the embedded graph object.

The NX version produces ints from the code below, while the RX
version produces floats.  I don't think this matters as the laplacian
matrix is used to do numerical calculations, so that code should
happily use ints or floats, but it means that for this test I need
to convert the NX version's result to have floating point values.
