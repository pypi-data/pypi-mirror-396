def test_subgraph(four_by_five_graph_rx):
    """
    Subgraphs are one of the most dangerous areas of the code.
    In NX, subgraphs preserve node_ids - that is, the node_id
    in the subgraph is the same as the node_id in the parent.
    However, in RX, that is not the case - RX always creates
    new node_ids starting at 0 and increasing by one
    sequentially, so in general a node in an RX subgraph
    will have a different node_id than it has in the parent
    graph.

    To deal with this, the code creates a map from the
    node_id in a subgraph to the node_id in the parent
    graph, _node_id_to_parent_node_id_map.  This test verifies
    that this map is properly created.

    In addition, all RX based graphs that came from an NX
    based graph record the "original" NX node_ids in
    another node_id map, _node_id_to_original_nx_node_id_map

    When we create a subgraph, this map needs to be
    established for the subgraph.  This test verifies
    that this map is properly created.

    Note that this test is only configured to work on
    RX based Graph objects because the only uses of subgraph
    in the gerrychain codebase is on RX based Graph objects.

TODO: Code: ???

  * Aliasing concerns:

    It occurs to me that the RX node_data is aliased with the NX node_data.
    That is, the data dictionaries in the NX Graph are just retained
    when the NX Graph is converted to be an RX Graph - so if you change
    the data in the RX Graph, the NX Graph from which we created the RX
    graph will also be changed.

    I believe that this is also true for subgraphs for both NX and RX,
    meaning that the node_data in the subgraph is the exact same
    data dictionary in the parent graph and the subgraph.

    I am not sure if this is a problem or not, but it is something
    to be tested / thought about...

  * NX allows node_ids to be almost anything - they can be integers,
    strings, even tuples.  I think that they just need to be hashable.

    I don't know if we need to test that non-integer NX node_ids
    don't cause a problem.  There are tests elsewhere that have
    NX node_ids that are tuples, and that test passes, so I think
    we are OK, but there are no tests specifically targeting this
    issue that I know of.
