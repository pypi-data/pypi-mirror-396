# jupyterlab-ghostty

A JupyterLab extension that provides a terminal emulator powered by [ghostty-web](https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web) (`libghostty` WASM).

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Installation

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-ghostty
```

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab-ghostty
```

## Development Installation

For a development installation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eexwhyzee/jupyterlab-ghostty.git
cd jupyterlab-ghostty

# Install dependencies
jlpm install

# Build the extension
jlpm build

# Install the extension in development mode
pip install -e "."

# Link the extension for development
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite

## Usage

Once installed, you'll see a "Ghostty Terminal" option in:

1. **Launcher**: Click the "Ghostty Terminal" icon in the "Other" section
