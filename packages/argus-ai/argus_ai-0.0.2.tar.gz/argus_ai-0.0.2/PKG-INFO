# Argus AI
The All-Seeing Orchestrator for Hierarchical Autonomous Agents.

Argus AI is a Python library built on top of LangGraph that decomposes complex user requests into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks, dispatches them to the most relevant sub-agents, and manages their lifecycle with robust error handling and JIT routing.

## Features (Coming Soon)
- Hierarchical Agent Orchestration
- Dynamic JIT Routing (Late Binding)
- Fractal Orchestration (Sub-graphs as Agents)
- Decentralized Retry Logic

## Installation
```
pip install argus-ai
```

## Status

Under active development.
