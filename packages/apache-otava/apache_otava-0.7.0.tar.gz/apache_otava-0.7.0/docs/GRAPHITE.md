# Importing results from Graphite

> [!TIP]
> See [otava.yaml](../examples/graphite/otava.yaml) for the full example configuration.

## Graphite and Grafana Connection

The following block contains Graphite and Grafana connection details:

```yaml
graphite:
  url: ...

grafana:
  url: ...
  user: ...
  password: ...
```

These variables can be specified directly in `otava.yaml` or passed as environment variables:

```yaml
graphite:
  url: ${GRAPHITE_ADDRESS}

grafana:
  url: ${GRAFANA_ADDRESS}
  user: ${GRAFANA_USER}
  password: ${GRAFANA_PASSWORD}
```


## Tests

### Importing results from Graphite

Test configuration contains queries selecting experiment data from Graphite. This is done by specifying the Graphite
path prefix common for all the test's metrics and suffixes for each of the metrics recorded by the test run.

```yaml
tests:
  my-product.test:
    type: graphite
    prefix: performance-tests.daily.my-product
    metrics:
      throughput:
        suffix: client.throughput
      response-time:
        suffix: client.p50
        direction: -1    # lower is better
      cpu-load:
        suffix: server.cpu
        direction: -1    # lower is better
```

### Tags

> [!WARNING]
> Tags do not work as expected in the current version. See https://github.com/apache/otava/issues/24 for more details

The optional `tags` property contains the tags that are used to query for Graphite events that store
additional test run metadata such as run identifier, commit, branch and product version information.

The following command will post an event with the test run metadata:
```shell
$ curl -X POST "http://graphite_address/events/" \
    -d '{
      "what": "Performance Test",
      "tags": ["perf-test", "daily", "my-product"],
      "when": 1537884100,
      "data": {"commit": "fe6583ab", "branch": "new-feature", "version": "0.0.1"}
    }'
```

Posting those events is not mandatory, but when they are available, Otava is able to
filter data by commit or version using `--since-commit` or `--since-version` selectors.

## Example

Start docker-compose with Graphite in one tab:

```bash
docker-compose -f examples/graphite/docker-compose.yaml up --force-recreate --always-recreate-deps --renew-anon-volumes --build
````

Run otava in another tab:

```bash
docker-compose -f examples/graphite/docker-compose.yaml run otava analyze my-product.test --since=-10m
```

Expected output:

```bash
time                       run    branch    version    commit      throughput    response_time    cpu_usage
