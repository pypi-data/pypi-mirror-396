# Aries-Askar

[![pypi releases](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aries_askar)](https://pypi.org/project/aries-askar/)

A Python wrapper around the `aries-askar` Rust library, this module provides secure storage support for Hyperledger Aries agents.

## Credit

The initial implementation of `aries-askar` was developed by the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) team based at the Province of British Columbia. The database structure derives largely from the wallet design within [Hyperledger Indy-SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk). To learn more about VON and what's happening with decentralized identity in British Columbia, please go to [https://vonx.io](https://vonx.io).
