```

### Note for MacOS users:  
If you receive an error like "SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xe0'", include the following at the top of your python codes before the import statement.  
```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```  

### Example
```
from simpleLanguageRecognizer import languageRecognizer

input = "This is an example of a short phrase in English but which is longer than 50 characters."
output = languageRecognizer(input)
print(output)

output = languageRecognizer(input,False,3,0.25)
print(output)
```

### Input arguments

- allLanguages (bool) (Optional): True (All languages) / False (Only European/Latin-based languages). The function works faster when allLanguages is set to False.  
- maxResults (int) (Optional): The maximum length of the output array. The output array might be empty if the input string is not recognized.
