# SevenNet

SevenNet (Scalable EquiVariance-Enabled Neural Network) is a graph neural network (GNN)-based interatomic potential package that supports parallel molecular dynamics simulations using [`LAMMPS`](https://lammps.org). Its core model is based on [`NequIP`](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip).

Full documentation, including **installation**, **usage**, and **pretrained models**, is available at [documentation](https://sevennet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Features
 - Pretrained GNN interatomic potential and fine-tuning interface
 - [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) calculator (python)
 - GPU-parallelized molecular dynamics with LAMMPS
 - CUDA-accelerated D3 (van der Waals) dispersion
 - Multi-fidelity training for combining multiple databases with different calculation settings
 - [Tensor product accelerators](https://sevennet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/accelerator.html)


## Pretrained Models

SevenNet provides pretrained models (universal potentials).
Please refer to the documentation for available checkpoints, and usage examples: [Pretrained models](https://sevennet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/pretrained.html)

## Installation and user guides

Installation (including LAMMPS and D3) and user guides can be found in our [documentation](https://sevennet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The old README (prior to v0.12.0) can be found [here](./docs/old_readme/).
