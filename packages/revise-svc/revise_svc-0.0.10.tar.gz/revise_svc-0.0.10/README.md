# REVISE

REVISE (REconstruction via Vision-integrated Spatial Estimation) is a unified framework for reconstructing **Spatially-inferred Virtual Cells (SVCs)** by integrating spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, histological imaging, and matched single-cell RNA-seq references.

Visit our [documentation](https://revise-svc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation, tutorials, examples and more. Download Sim2Real benchmark, generated results and Real application data in  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17705737). Put them into [raw_data](./raw_data) dir if you want to reproduce our results.

You can also check out our [podcast](https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/938384285) and watch our intro [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7u3jlu-qjY) for a quick overview.

## Motivation

Current ST technologies are limited by six key **confounding factors (CFs)** that hinder the reconstruction of biologically coherent single-cell units:

![ST limitations](png/ST_limitations.png)

<p align="center">Current ST limitations</p>

- **Spatially heterogeneous CFs**: image segmentation artifacts, bin-to-cell assignment errors
- **Spatially homogeneous CFs**: spot size, batch effects, gene panel limitations, gene dropout

REVISE addresses these limitations through a **topology-aware hierarchical optimal transport (OT)** framework, generating two complementary types of virtual cells:

- **sp-SVC**: leverages spatial priors to correct spatially heterogeneous CFs and preserve local tissue architecture
- **sc-SVC**: integrates scRNA-seq references to restore transcriptome-wide coverage and correct dropout

## Highlights

- **Unified Framework**: Handles six CFs across three ST platforms (sST, iST, hST)
- **Dual SVC Modes**: sp-SVC for spatial refinement, sc-SVC for molecular completeness
- **Benchmark Module**: Reproducible evaluation pipelines for simulated or public datasets
- **Application Module**: Annotation, reconstruction, and downstream analyses for real ST data

## SVC Applications

### sp-SVC Applications

- Recovers spatially resolved gene and pathway signals from Visium HD data
- Identifies localized transcriptional programs (e.g., EMT at tumor leading edge)
- Enhances spatial autocorrelation and clustering coherence

### sc-SVC Applications

- Reconstructs whole-transcriptome profiles for Xenium data
- Defines fine-grained immune subtypes (T cells, TAMs, CAFs)
- Reveals spatially organized cell-cell communication and clinical associations

## Quick Start

Install the Python package via pip:

```bash
pip install revise-svc
```

If you want to use REVISE for a real ST application, please import these class:

```bash
# sp-SVC, usually for hST platforms (e.g., Visium HD)
from revise.application import SpSVC

# sc-SVC, usually for iST platforms (e.g., Xenium) and sST platforms (e.g., Visium)
from revise.application import ScSVC
```

If you want to use REVISE for benchmark (such as in our Sim2Real-ST benchmark setting), please import these class:

```bash
# For two spa-hetero CFs: segmentation error and bin2cell
from revise.benchmark import SpSVC

# For two spa-homo CFs: spot size and batch effect
from revise.benchmark import ScSVCSr

# For two spa-homo CFs: gene panel limitation and dropout
from revise.benchmark import ScSVCImpute
```

## Example

### Run benchmark settings (sp-SVC)
Please make sure that you have downloaded Sim2Real-ST benchmark datasets from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17705737).
```python
import scanpy as sc
import revise.benchmark as benchmark
from revise.benchmark import SpSVC
from revise.conf import BenchmarkSegConf

# Initialize the config class for sp-SVC, check the detailed API at https://revise-svc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api/generated/revise.conf.application_sp_conf.ApplicationSpConf.html
config = BenchmarkSegConf(
    sample_name=YOUR_OWN_SAMPLE_NAME,
    annotate_mode="pot",
    raw_data_path=YOUR_OWN_DATA_PATH,
    result_root_path=YOUR_OWN_RESULT_PATH,
    cell_type_col="Level1",
    confidence_col="Confidence",
    unknown_key="Unknown",
    st_file=YOUR_OWN_ST_FILE,
    gt_svc_file=YOUR_OWN_GT_SVC_FILE,
    sc_ref_file=YOUR_OWN_SC_REF_FILE,
    seg_method="seg_1",
)
adata_st = sc.read_h5ad(config.st_file_path)
adata_gt_svc = sc.read_h5ad(config.gt_svc_file_path)
adata_sc_ref = sc.read_h5ad(config.sc_ref_file_path)
svc = SpSVC(adata_st, adata_sc_ref, config, adata_gt_svc, None)
benchmark.main(svc)
```

### Run application settings

```python
import scanpy as sc
from revise.application import SpSVC
from revise.conf import ApplicationSpConf

config = ApplicationSpConf(
    sample_name=YOUR_OWN_SAMPLE_NAME,
    annotate_mode="pot",
    raw_data_path=YOUR_OWN_DATA_PATH,
    result_root_path=YOUR_OWN_RESULT_PATH,
    cell_type_col="Level1",
    confidence_col="Confidence",
    unknown_key="Unknown",
    st_file=YOUR_OWN_ST_FILE,
    sc_ref_file=YOUR_OWN_SC_REF_FILE,
)

adata_st = sc.read_h5ad(config.st_file_path)
adata_sc_ref = sc.read_h5ad(config.sc_ref_file_path)
svc = SpSVC(adata_st, adata_sc_ref, config=config, logger=None)
svc.global_anchoring()
svc.local_refinement()
```

## Reproducibility
If you want to reproduce our results based on the Sim2Real-ST benchmark setting, you can run single [bash](./reproduce/benchmark/benchmark_bin2cell.sh) script as following:

```bash
# for bin2cell
bash ./reproduce/benchmark/benchmark_bin2cell.sh

# for batch effect 
bash ./reproduce/benchmark/benchmark_batch_effect.sh

...
```

Or you can use our merged [benchmark_main.sh](./benchmark_main.sh) script as following:

```bash
bash benchmark_main.sh
```

## Repository Layout

- `revise/application`: SVC workflows for real datasets.
- `revise/benchmark`: SVC variants for benchmarking studies.
- `revise/methods`: Algorithm implementations and model components.
- `revise/tools`: Distance metrics, logging helpers, and general utilities.
- `conf`: Example configurations and experiment parameters.

revise-svc exposes SVC interfaces with matching conf files: every SVC derives from `BaseSVC`, which defines initialization plus the abstract `global_anchoring` and `local_refinement` methods. `BaseSVCAnchor` extends `BaseSVC` and provides the shared `global_anchoring` used by all SVCs. SVCs are grouped into application and benchmark: application implements `SpSVC` and `ScSVC`; benchmark implements `SpSVC`, `ScSVCImpute`, and `ScSVCSr`. `SpSVC` targets segmentation and bin2cell confounding factors; `ScSVCImpute` targets gene panel and gene dropout; `ScSVCSr` targets batch effect and spot size. Conf implementations mirror the SVCs one-to-one, with parameters available on the website.
