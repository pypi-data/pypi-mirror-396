principles:
  - Use constructor injection and mark dependencies final
  - Prefer interfaces over concrete implementations
  - Use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable resources
  - Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase methods, PascalCase classes)
  - Use @Override annotation consistently
  - Prefer specific exceptions over generic Exception

forbidden:
  - String comparison with == instead of .equals()
  - Catching generic Exception or Throwable in production code
  - System.exit() in library code
  - Raw types without generics

patterns:
  error_handling: "Use specific exception types with meaningful messages"
  dependency_injection: "Constructor injection with final fields"
