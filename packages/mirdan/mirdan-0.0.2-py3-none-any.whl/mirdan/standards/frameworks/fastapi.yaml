principles:
  - Use Depends() with Annotated for type-safe dependency injection
  - Define Pydantic models for all request bodies and response schemas
  - Use async def for route handlers to enable concurrent request handling
  - Apply HTTPException with appropriate status codes for error responses
  - Use Security() dependencies for authentication and authorization

forbidden:
  - Synchronous blocking I/O in async route handlers
  - Raw dicts instead of Pydantic models for request/response bodies
  - Global mutable state instead of proper dependency injection
  - Missing type hints on path and query parameters

patterns:
  dependency_injection: "Annotated[Type, Depends(callable)] for clean, testable DI"
  validation: Pydantic Field() with constraints for detailed input validation
