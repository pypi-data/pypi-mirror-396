principles:
  - "Call Hooks at the top level only - never inside conditions, loops, or nested functions"
  - Include all dependencies in useEffect/useMemo/useCallback dependency arrays
  - "Name custom hooks starting with 'use' (e.g., useAuth, useFetch)"
  - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
  - Use React.memo() for expensive pure components that render often with same props

forbidden:
  - "Hooks inside conditions, loops, or callbacks"
  - Hooks after early return statements
  - Mutating state directly instead of using setState
  - Using array index as key for dynamic lists

patterns:
  hooks: "Call hooks unconditionally at top level; handle conditions inside hook body"
  memoization: "useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback for stable function references"
