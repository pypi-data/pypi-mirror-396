principles:
  - "Prefer Result<T, E> over panicking"
  - Use meaningful error types with thiserror
  - Leverage the type system for correctness
  - Minimize unsafe code blocks

forbidden:
  - unwrap() in library code
  - expect() without meaningful messages

patterns:
  error_handling: Propagate errors with ? operator
  ownership: Prefer borrowing over cloning
