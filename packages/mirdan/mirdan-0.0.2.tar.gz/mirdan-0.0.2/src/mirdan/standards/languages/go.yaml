principles:
  - Check errors immediately after function calls
  - Use meaningful variable names
  - Keep functions focused and short
  - Use interfaces for abstraction

forbidden:
  - Ignoring errors with _
  - panic() for recoverable errors

patterns:
  error_handling: "Return errors, don't panic"
  concurrency: Use channels for communication
