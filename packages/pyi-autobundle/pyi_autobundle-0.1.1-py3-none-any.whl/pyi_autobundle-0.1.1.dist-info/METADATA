 # pyi-autobundle

Automatic hook and data file bundler for PyInstaller — a tool to help
generate hooks, collect package assets, and produce PyInstaller spec files
automatically so you can build portable binaries with a single command.

**Key Features**
- Static AST import scanning and basic dynamic import detection.
- Optional runtime import tracing to capture imports that only appear at runtime.
- Package inspection to collect datas (images, JSON, templates, ML models) and native binaries.
- Automatic generation of PyInstaller `hook-*.py` files and a working `.spec` file.
- One-command CLI: `pybundle` (entrypoint: `pyi_autobundle.cli:main`).
- Centralized configuration via `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pyi-autobundle]`.
- `.buildignore` support to exclude files, directories, or patterns from inclusion.
- Built-in hidden-imports database for common problematic packages (numpy, pandas, torch, PIL).
- `--dry-run` mode to audit what would be included without building.

Installation
------------
Install in editable/development mode or as a package in your Python environment:

```cmd
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install pyinstaller
```

CLI Usage
---------
Basic one-command build:

```cmd
pybundle path\to\main.py --trace
```

Common flags:
- `--trace` : run the runtime import tracer in addition to static scanning
- `--onefile` : build a single-file executable (PyInstaller `--onefile`)
- `--windowed` : create a windowed app (no console)
- `--hooks-dir` : directory to write generated hooks (default: `.pyi-hooks`)
- `--buildignore` : path to a `.buildignore` file to exclude assets
- `--dry-run` : list files/modules that would be included and exit

Configuration (pyproject.toml)
------------------------------
You can set default build options in `pyproject.toml` under the `tool.pyi-autobundle` table. Example:

```toml
[tool.pyi-autobundle]
onefile = true
windowed = false
name = "myapp"
icon = "assets/app.ico"
```

The CLI will merge values from this config with any flags you pass on the command line.

.buildignore
-----------
Place a `.buildignore` file in your project root to exclude files or patterns from being collected.
Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments. Example:

```
# exclude tests and dataset
tests/
data/raw/
*.log
```

Resource discovery
------------------
If your code uses a helper like `get_resource_path("assets/icon.png")`, the static scanner
attempts to detect literal calls and automatically include referenced files in the build.

Dry-run audit
-------------
Use `--dry-run` to print a report of `datas`, `binaries`, and `hiddenimports` that would
be included by the build process without invoking PyInstaller.
