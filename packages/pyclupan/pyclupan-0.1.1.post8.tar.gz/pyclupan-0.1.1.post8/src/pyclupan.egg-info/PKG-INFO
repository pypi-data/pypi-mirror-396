# pyclupan: Cluster Expansion Tools for Alloy and Substitutional Ionic Systems

`pyclupan` is a Python package for developing substitutional cluster expansion models based on datasets obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The code also enables the enumeration of nonequivalent substitutional derivative structures, the calculation of correlation (cluster) functions, Monte Carlo simulations, and the evaluation of free energies for multicomponent substitutional systems.
