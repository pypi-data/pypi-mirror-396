*Multilayer networks* are complex networks with additional information assigned to nodes or edges (or both). This library includes
some of the state-of-the-art algorithms for decomposition, visualization and analysis of such networks.

**Key Features:**
* SQL-like DSL for intuitive network queries with smart defaults
* Multilayer network visualization and analysis
* Community detection and centrality measures
* Network decomposition and embeddings


```python
from py3plex.core import datasets
from py3plex.dsl import Q, UQ
from py3plex.algorithms.community_detection import multilayer_louvain

# 1. Load a built-in multilayer biological network (~500 nodes, 4 layers)
network = datasets.fetch_multilayer("human_ppi_gene_disease_drug")

# 2. Run multilayer community detection
partition_vector, Q_modularity = multilayer_louvain(network, gamma=1.2, random_state=42)
network.assign_partition(partition_vector)

# 3. Find master regulator candidates with uncertainty quantification
master_regulators = (
    Q.nodes()
     .node_type("gene")                        # Filter by node type
     .where(degree__gt=3)                      # Remove peripheral genes
     .uq(method="perturbation", n_samples=100, ci=0.95, seed=42)  # Quantify confidence
     .per_layer()                              # Group by layer
        .compute("degree_centrality", "betweenness_centrality")
        .top_k(20, "betweenness_centrality__mean")  # Top 20 per layer by mean
     .end_grouping()
     .sort(by="betweenness_centrality__mean", descending=True)
     .limit(20)                                # Final top 20 candidates
     .execute(network)
)

df = master_regulators.to_pandas(expand_uncertainty=True)
print(df[["id", "layer", "betweenness_centrality", "betweenness_centrality_std", 
          "betweenness_centrality_ci95_low", "betweenness_centrality_ci95_high"]].head(10))

abstract={Complex networks are used as means for representing multimodal, real-life systems. With increasing amounts of data that lead to large multilayer networks consisting of different node and edge types, that can also be subject to temporal change, there is an increasing need for versatile visualization and analysis software. This work presents a lightweight Python library, Py3plex, which focuses on the visualization and analysis of multilayer networks. The library implements a set of simple graphical primitives supporting intra- as well as inter-layer visualization. It also supports many common operations on multilayer networks, such as aggregation, slicing, indexing, traversal, and more. The paper also focuses on how node embeddings can be used to speed up contemporary (multilayer) layout computation. The library's functionality is showcased on both real and synthetic networks.},

abstract="Real-life systems are commonly represented as networks of interacting entities. While homogeneous networks consist of nodes of a single node type, multilayer networks are characterized by multiple types of nodes or edges, all present in the same system. Analysis and visualization of such networks represent a challenge for real-life complex network applications. The presented Py3plex Python-based library facilitates the exploration and visualization of multilayer networks. The library includes a diagonal projection-based network visualization, developed specifically for large networks with multiple node (and edge) types. The library also includes state-of-the-art methods for network decomposition and statistical analysis. The Py3plex functionality is showcased on real-world multilayer networks from the domains of biology and on synthetic networks.",
