The pch module contains libraries for:

* Calculating photon counting histograms
* Fitting histograms with Fluorescence Intensity Distribution Analysis (FIDA)

The tools module contains libraries for:

* Fitting various models to data (polynomial, Gaussian, power law, etc.)

## Getting started 

### Supported file types

The current version of the package can read FFS data in .h5, .tiff, .ptu, and .czi files.

For .h5 files generated with BrightEyes-MCS, no pre-processing is needed. For custom .h5 files, make sure to use the keyword 'data' to store the [Nt x Nc] array of FFS data, with *Nt* the number of time points and *Nc* the number of channels (detector elements). The easiest way to generate correct .h5 files is with the function *brighteyes_ffs.fcs.meas_to_count.numpy2h5*, which takes a 2D numpy array as input. If the data contains photon arrival times, the file must contain datasets called "det0", "det1", etc., with each dataset a 2D array [Np x 2] with *Np* the number of photons, the first column the macrotime in ps, and the second column the microtime in ps.

For .tiff, make sure the data contains one page with a 2D array [Nt x Nc]. Make sure the dwell time in microseconds is stored as a tag called 'dwell_time'.

For .czi files, the data is automatically converted to .h5 upon calculating the correlation. However, the dwell time cannot be automatically read. Instead, make sure a .txt file with the following syntax is stored in the same location as the .czi file. If your file is located at *my_path/my_file.czi*, then add a .txt file with the same name, i.e. *my_path/my_file.txt*, with exactly the following two lines of information:

	DWELL TIME [us]
	17

Replace *17* with your actual dwell time in microseconds. BrightEyes-FFS will automatically generate an .h5 file stored in the same location.

For .ptu files taken with the PicoQuant Luminosa PDA-23 array detector, no pre-processing is needed.

### Calculating correlations

The variable *file* contains the path to the data file (.h5 or .czi). The variable *accuracy* defines the number of points for which the correlation is calculated. The higher this number, the more points G contains. Note that accuracy does not (always) equal the number of points. The variable *split* contains the duration of a single chunk of data for which the correlation is calculated. E.g. for a 100 s time trace, split=20 will result in 5 correlations from a 20 s time trace each. The boolean *time_trace* defines whether or not the time trace should be returned. The variable *algorithm* defines the algorithm used to calculate the correlation. Valid options are 'multipletau' (time-based) and 'wiener-khinchin' (fft based).

The variable *list_of_g* contains the various correlations to be calculated. Acceptable entries are (i) integer numbers for calculating the autocorrelation of a given channel, (ii) a pre-defined string (such as 'central', 'sum3', and 'sum5') or (iii) a custom-made string with the following syntax 'Ca+b+...+cxd+...+e': starting with C (for Custom), then a list of channels to sum over (a+b+c), then x, then a second list of channels to sum over. E.g. 'C0+1x2+3' calculates tha cross-correlation between the sum of the channels 0 and 1 and the sum of channels 2 and 3. To calculate the autocorrelation, use simply 'Ca+b+c' (which is equivalent to 'Ca+b+cxa+b+c'). For cross-correlations of single channels, use 'xaabb' with aa and bb the two channel numbers (e.g. 'x0123' for the cross-correlation between channels 1 and 23).


	from brighteyes_ffs.fcs.fcs2corr import fcs_load_and_corr_split as correlate
	list_of_g = ['central', 'sum3', 'sum5']
	G, time_trace = correlate(file, list_of_g=list_of_g, accuracy=16, split=10, time_trace=True, algorithm='multipletau')

G is an object with 2D arrays (tau, G) for each correlation in list_of_g and each chunk of data, e.g. G.central_chunk0 contains the autocorrelation for the central detector element for the first chunk of data. *G.central_average* contains the average correlation for the central element over the whole data set.

To remove bad chunks of data, e.g. caused by a bright aggregate entering the focal volume, use the following code:

	good_chunks = [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # list with the good chunks of data, i.e., remove chunks 2 and 3 from further analysis
	G.average_chunks(good_chunks)
	
The output of *fcs_av_chunks* is the same object as before, but now containing attributes such as *G.central_averageX*, where the *X* stands for the custom average of the good chunks only.

### Fitting correlations

The library *fcs_fit* contains several fit functions. The variable *fitfun* can be 'fitfun_2c' (for 1 or 2-component free diffusion), 'fitfun_an' (for 1-component anomalous diffusion), 'fitfun_dualfocus' (for free diffusion with two focii displaced from each other), 'fitfun_circfcs' (for free diffusion with a circularly scanning excitation beam), 'mem_fit_free_diffusion' (for free diffusion with a large number of components), 'fitfun_free_diffusion_2d' (for 1 or 2-component free diffusion in 2D), or 'fcs_analytical_2c_anomalous' (for 2-component anomalous diffusion). The variable *fit_info* contains 0s and 1s for parameters that have to be kept fixed and fitted, respectively. The variable *param* contains the starting values for all parameters. Check the library for the order of parameters for each fit function.

	from brighteyes_ffs.fcs.fcs_fit import fcs_fit
	fitresults = []
	for corr in list_of_g:
		Gsingle = getattr(G, corr + '_averageX') # get the average correlation curve
		Gexp = Gsingle[1:,1]
		tau = Gsingle[1:,0]
		fitfun = 'fitfun_2c'
		fit_info = np.asarray([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]) # fit N, tauD, and offset (we fit with one component)
		param = np.asarray([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]) # starting values for all parameters
		lBounds = np.asarray([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])*(-1e6) # lower bounds for all parameters
		uBounds = np.asarray([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])*(1e6) # upper bounds for all parameters
		fitresult = fcs_fit(Gexp, tau, fitfun, fit_info, param, lBounds, uBounds, plotInfo=-1)
		fitresults.append(fitresult)

The variable *fitresults* contains a list of *N* elements, with *N* = len(list_of_g), in which each element is the output of a scipy.optimize.least_squares call. E.g. fitresults[0].fun contains the residuals for the first fit (typically the detector central element in spot-variation FCS). Similarly, fitresults[0].x contains the fitted parameter values.

### Checking the diffusion law

In spot-variation FCS, the diffusion law tau_D vs w0^2 is plotted and fitted with a linear curve to derive the diffusion modality. Here, tau_D is the diffusion time and w0^2 the beam waist squared for each of the three curves, as found in a calibration measurement. For free diffusion, the fit must go through the origin. A positive intercept with the y-axis means anomalous diffusion caused by microdomain formation, a negative intercept anomalous diffusion caused by a meshwork. To check the diffusion law, use:

	taufit = np.asarray([fitresults[i].x[0] for i in range(3)]) # diffusion times in ms for the three curves
	w0 = np.asarray([220, 290, 364])*1e-3 # beam waists from calibration in micrometer
	fitresult = fit_curve(taufit, w0**2, 'linear', [1, 1], param=[1, 1], lBounds=[-1e6, -1e6], uBounds=[1e6, 1e6], savefig=0) # use 'linear' for y = a*x + b, param = starting values

Plotting the diffusion law:

	taufitres = np.zeros(len(w0) + 1)
	taufitres[0] = fitresult.x[1]
	taufitres[1:] = taufit - fitresult.fun

	w02fit = np.zeros(len(w0) + 1)
	w02fit[1:] = w0**2

	plt.figure()
	plt.scatter(w0**2, taufit)
	plt.plot(w02fit, taufitres)
