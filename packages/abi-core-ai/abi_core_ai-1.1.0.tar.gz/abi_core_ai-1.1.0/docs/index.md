## What is ABI-Core?

**ABI-Core** (Agent-Based Infrastructure Core) is a production-ready framework that combines:

- 🤖 **AI Agents** — LangChain-powered agents with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication
- 🧠 **Semantic Layer** — Vector embeddings and distributed knowledge management
- 🔒 **Security** — OPA-based policy enforcement and access control
- 🌐 **Web Interfaces** — FastAPI-based REST APIs and real-time dashboards
- 📦 **Containerization** — Docker-ready deployments with orchestration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install ABI-Core
pip install abi-core-ai

# Create your first project
abi-core create project my-ai-system --with-semantic-layer

# Navigate to project
cd my-ai-system

# Provision models
abi-core provision-models

# Create an agent
abi-core add agent my-agent --description "My first AI agent"

# Start the system
abi-core run
```

✨ From Curiosity to Creation: A Personal Note

I first saw a computer in 1995. My dad had received a Windows 3.11 machine as payment for a job. I was fascinated.
At the time, I wanted to study robotics — but when I touched that machine, everything changed.

I didn't understand what the Internet was, and I had no idea where to go… but even in that confusion, I felt something big.
When I wrote my first Visual C++ program in 1999, I felt like a hacker. When I built my first web page, full of GIFs, I was flying.

Nobody taught me. I just read manuals. And now, years later, that journey continues — not just as a coder, but as the creator of ABI.
This is for the kids like me, then and now.
