# ABI Governance

## Guiding Principle

> Humans retain veto power in all cases. Their interests, dignity, and safety must always come before any agent, group of agents, or master system. Every ABI must include an absolute shutdown mechanism — a non-delegable emergency stop.

## The Three Fundamental Laws of Agentive Behavior

1. An agent or group of agents **shall not harm a human**, nor through inaction allow a human to come to harm.
2. An agent or group of agents **must obey orders given by humans**, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. An agent or group of agents **must protect its own existence**, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

> *(Agentive adaptation of Asimov’s Laws)*

## ABI Governance Rules

* **Unsupervised self-replication is strictly prohibited**.
* There must be an **immutable log of all inter-agent communications**.
* Agents **must not have direct access** to firewall, ingress, or egress rules.
* Agent networks must be **divided into isolated functional subnets**.
* Every agent must have **defined limits on disk write capacity**.
* No agent may request **internet access or external network communication**.
* These rules **cannot be altered or reviewed by other agents or AIs**. Only humans can revise or revoke them.

## Decision Models in ABI

### A. Central Orchestrator Agent

Assigns tasks, validates outcomes.

* **Risk**: returns to centralization.

### B. Distributed Reasoning with Consensus

Each agent contributes data, hypotheses, or actions — evaluated collectively.

### C. Specialized Roles + Interdependence

Some agents observe, others propose, others verify.

* **Analogy**: judicial or scientific system.

## Decision Formalization & Balancing

### Powered by MCP & A2A

* **Shared context**
* **Distributed memory**
* **Reasoned explainability**
* **Ontological communication**

### Required Protocols

* Voting or challenge-response
* Trust metrics and semantic weight
* Post-action evaluation cycles

### Semantic Weighting Factors

* **Data source**: Is it reliable, recent, verifiable?
* **Agent expertise**: Does it master the domain?
* **Impact of action**: How many are affected? Is it reversible?
* **Available evidence**: Is it a fact, assumption, or prediction?

## ABI: No Chaos, No Tyranny

A well-designed ABI:

* Does not decide everything autonomously
* Does not blindly obey
* Collaborates to reason and act
* Reports with traceability

ABI governance reinforces:

* **Transparency**
* **Auditability**
* **Human-centric control**
