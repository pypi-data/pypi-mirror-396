## Experience
<!-- Raw moments, thoughts, what's happening -->

- exploring making Mind a proper installable package - would eliminate uv --directory complexity
- mind init CLI is working now - was it fixed earlier? user reported it wasn't working before
- investigating multi-project support issues - user reports Mind can't run on multiple projects and CLI commands not working
