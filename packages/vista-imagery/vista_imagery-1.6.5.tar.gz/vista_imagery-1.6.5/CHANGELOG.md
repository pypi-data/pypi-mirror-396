All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.5] - 2025-12-13

### New Features
- Added `VISTA_LABELS` environment variable to pre-configure labels from CSV files, JSON files, or comma-separated values

### Improvements
- Moved label management into view menu due to issues with actions on primary app menu on iOS

## [1.6.4] - 2025-12-1

### Improvements
- Added settings menu for some global configuration settings
- Improved the speed and effectiveness of computing the image histograms on realistic data
- Added subset frames algorithm to trim imagery
- Updated Robust PCA so that it can be canceled and provides incremental progress updates.
- Updated so that automatic histogram limits set to limits of histogram plot, not data

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug where progress dialog would close when loading imagery before the histogram creationg progress dialog would open 
- Forced loaded imagery to cast to float32. All image processing algorithms assume data are floating point values.

## [1.6.3] - 2025-11-30

### Improvements
- Improved imagery read speed by ~30%.

## [1.6.2] - 2025-11-29

### Improvements
- Removed unncessary `requirements.txt`
- Added `vista/simulate/data/earth_image.png` to manifest
- Added `CHANGELOG.md`
- Updated TOML to prevent installing non `vista` directories.

## [1.6.1] - 2025-11-25

### New Features
 - Added new `File` menu option to `Simulate` data to make it easier for new users to get familiar with the tool.

### Improvements
 - Greatly improved playback efficiency for tracks and detections by caching more data to prevent costly lookups
 - Consolidated hundreds of lines of duplicative code
 - Consolidated algorithms widgets into new `algorithms` sub-package under `widgets`
 - Added the ability to re-open the point selection dialog after closing it 
 - Updated Robust PCA to have an indefinite progressbar rather than a four part progress bar that would hang at 25%
 - Histogram gradient settings are now saved across sessions
 - Added logo ICO file to enable create executable distributions with `pyinstaller`.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed bug with threshold detector when run on an AOI
 - Fixed bugs with cursor type where it could be an arrow when it should be a crosshair and vice versa.
 - Added logic to prevent being in several states that take actions when the viewer is clicked simultaneously such as track creation and detection editing.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-25

### New Features

- Added multi-sensor support
- Added the ability to export imagery data
- Added the ability to label tracks and detections
- Select one or more tracks by clicking in viewer
- Added the ability to use features to aid in point selection
- Added the ability to add selected detections to track

### Improvements
 - Updated detections table line-width and marker size columns so that they have a larger width. 
 - Updated marker symbol columns in detections and tracks table to use full name rather than pyqtgraph abbreviations
 - Improved imagery HDF5 format to enable providing multiple sensors and imagery in a single file. Added warning dialog when user's loads deprecated v1.5 format
 - Improved app sizing
 - Improved geospatial tooltip icon 
 - File exporters now remember last exported location for subsequent exports
 - Removed unnecessary detection selection count and clear selection button
 - Improved the way detector editing works to enable removing or adding detections and only showing detections on each frame rather than all detections across all time

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-15

### New Features

- Updated as installable Python package
- Updated player so that current frame is kept when switching between imagery (when possible)
- Improved app space utilization
- Added copy and slice methods to `Track` object
- Updated Kalman tracker so that it's resulting tracks have the default track styling
- Added more `Imagery` radiometric properties.

### Fixed Bugs
- Fixed bug with refreshing the tracks table

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-14

### New Features

- Updated the pixel value tooltip to show coorindates of hover as well as pixel value
- Updated robust PCA to work more like the other image processing algorithms
- refactored data manager
- Added imagery treatments
- Add radiometric imagery components
- Consolidated some duplicative callbacks in the main window
- Updated detectors so that they only run on the currently selected imagery
- Updated how histogram limits are set on imagery so that user defined limits are remembered for each imagery separately
- Added the ability to select tracks by clicking the viewer
- Added the ability to click on the imagery viewer to select tracks
- Added the ability to split tracks
- Added the ability to merge tracks
- Made it easier to know what track in the viewer is selected in the tracks table by temporarily increasing the line width and marker size
 - Updated how track and detection row selection work and how rows are highlighted to be more intuitive
 - Moved track action buttons to their own row. Move clear filters button into the table conext menu


## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-12

### New Features

- Added the ability to run VISTA programmatically
- Updated the documentation to make clear that it is assumed that tracks are at zero altitude.
- Updated tracks export so that it can include track times and geolocation
- Added a multi-stage tracker
- Updated all trackers to use indeterminate progressbars.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-12

### New Features

- Updated CFAR and threshold detectors to enable finding pixel groups that are darker, brighter, or both than their threshold.

### Fixes

- Updated documentation to clarify that it is assumed that the x,y least square polynomial arguments correspond to column, row or longitude, latitude.
- Fixed bug where detectors failed to take into account the 0.5, 0.5 pixel offset required to be centered on the detected pixel / pixel group.
- Fixed bug where row / col offsets were being applied to geospatial tooltip arguments to LSQ Polynomials when they shouldn't have been
- Fixed bug where coaddition did not carry forward least square polynomials for geolocation

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-11

### New Features

- Added the ability to show and hide track table columns in the data manager by right clicking on the track header.
- Added the ability to turn on / off track lines altogether leaving only the marker.
- Added the ability to set the track line style.
- Updated the application so that it remembers it's previous screen location and size
- Improved the behavior of the data manager width and track table column sizing
- Updated several algorithms that do not provide incremental progress to show an indeterminate progress bar instead.
- Updated application so that spacebar can be used to pause / play application even if play button is not in focus.
- Added a citation file.

### Fixes

- Fixed bug where imagery projection least squares polynomials did not carry forward into processed imagery created by the application.
- Fixed bug where tooltips did not take into account imagery row / column offsets.
- Fixed bug where imagery produced by algorithms did not have pre-computed histograms (which improves playback performance)
