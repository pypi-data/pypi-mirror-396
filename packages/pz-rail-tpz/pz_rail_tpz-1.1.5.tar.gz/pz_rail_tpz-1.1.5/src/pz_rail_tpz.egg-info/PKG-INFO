"Lite" version of Matias Carrasco-Kind's TPZ (Trees for Photo-z) regression-tree-based photo-z code.  This initial version **only** implements the regression-tree mode, it does not implement the classification tree or SOM-based photo-z estimators.  All credit on algorithm development and initial coding goes to Matias Carrasco-Kind.

If you use TPZ for any publication, in addition to RAIL, you should cite Matias' TPZ paper:
Carrasco Kind, M., & Brunner, R. J., 2013 “TPZ : Photometric redshift PDFs and ancillary information by using prediction trees and random forests”, MNRAS, 432, 1483 [Link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1483C/abstract)

For more details on the algorith, see Matias's MLZ website:
http://matias-ck.com/mlz/

For the regression tree mode, the current implementation includes generation of "random" data via Gaussian scatter on each of the attributes that contain an uncertainty, but it does **not** implement the out-of-bag error or varImportance sampling that are included in the full MLZ/TPZ package.
