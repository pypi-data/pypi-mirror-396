## Overview

This repository contains a Python package designed for modular and efficient text processing workflows. Currently, it includes the following subpackages:

- **Language Identification Pipeline**: Identifies the language of input text and returns a probability score.
- **OCR QA Pipeline**: Assesses the quality of OCR text by estimating the proportion of recognized vocabulary items (0–1), using efficient language-specific Bloom filters.
- **LDA Topic Modeling Pipeline**: Soft clustering of input texts using LDA-based topic modeling.
- **News Agencies Pipeline**: Extracts and ranks news agency entities from text, providing relevance scores and optional links to Wikidata.
- **Advertisement Classifier**: Identifies advertisements in historical newspaper content using a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model with rule-based features.
- **Lucene/Solr normalization Pipeline**: Replicates Solr's language-specific text normalization to clarify how input text is tokenized and indexed in impresso.

## Installation

### Quick Install (with uv - recommended)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is an extremely fast Python package installer (10-100x faster than pip):

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install the package with all dependencies
uv pip install "impresso-pipelines[all]"
```

### Standard Install (with pip)

To install the full package with all submodules:

```bash
pip install "impresso-pipelines[all]"
```

The `[all]` extra installs all dependencies required for each component.

### Install Individual Modules

To install individual modules without unnecessary dependencies, use:

```bash
pip install "impresso-pipelines[langident]"         # Language Identification
pip install "impresso-pipelines[ocrqa]"             # OCR QA
pip install "impresso-pipelines[ldatopics]"         # LDA Topics
pip install "impresso-pipelines[newsagencies]"      # News Agencies
pip install "impresso-pipelines[adclassifier]"      # Advertisement Classifier
pip install "impresso-pipelines[solrnormalization]" # Solr text normalization
```

### Development Setup

For contributors, we support both **uv** (faster) and **Poetry**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/impresso/impresso-pipelines.git
cd impresso-pipelines

# Option 1: Using uv (recommended - 3-6x faster)
uv sync --extra all --extra dev

# Option 2: Using Poetry
poetry install --all-extras --with dev

# Or use Make (auto-detects uv or Poetry)
make install-dev
```

See [UV_MIGRATION.md](UV_MIGRATION.md) for more details on using uv.

## Usage

Each pipeline is instantiated from a corresponding class.

```python
from impresso_pipelines.langident import LangIdentPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ocrqa import OCRQAPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ldatopics import LDATopicsPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.newsagencies import NewsAgenciesPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.adclassifier import AdClassifierPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.solrnormalization import SolrNormalizationPipeline
```

## Future Plans

Additional functionality will be added to extend use cases and support further processing tasks.

## Local Development

For contributors and developers who want to test locally before pushing to GitHub:

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/impresso/impresso-pipelines.git
cd impresso-pipelines

# Option 1: Poetry (recommended for full development)
make install-dev

# Option 2: Pip editable mode (faster for testing changes)
make install-editable-dev

# Run tests
make test

# Run all QA checks (mimics CI)
make qa
```

### Available Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make install          # Install package with all extras
make install-dev      # Install with dev dependencies
make test             # Run tests (skipping JVM tests)
make test-all         # Run all tests including JVM tests
make test-ocrqa       # Run only OCRQA tests
make test-cov         # Run tests with coverage report
make lint             # Run linting checks
make format           # Format code with black
make type-check       # Run type checking
make qa               # Run all QA checks
make clean            # Remove build artifacts
```
