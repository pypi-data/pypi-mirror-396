## 🚀 Decision-Making Process

| Topic | Method |
|---|---|

Minor features | PR review & consensus |
Major features | Proposal + maintainer approval |
Breaking changes | Project lead approval |
Security issues | Project lead authority |
Governance changes | Maintainer proposal + project lead approval |

Consensus is preferred; disagreement escalates to the project lead.

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution
