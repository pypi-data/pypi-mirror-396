`fuso` comes from the Italian word _fusione_, which translates to _fusion_. This is exactly what this library does; it creates a fusion between two dictionaries.

The goal of this library is to offer a customizable way of deeply merging dictionaries. In its simplest form, `fuso` offers an experience like other well-established dictionary merging libraries such as [`deepmerge`](https://pypi.org/project/deepmerge/), [`mergedeep`](https://pypi.org/project/mergedeep/).

However, where this library differs is that it allows the user to specify custom `merge_functions` that should be applied for specific dot paths.

For example, you may want to concatenate lists found at the dot path `settings.plugins`, but for other lists, you may want to replace them entirely. With `fuso`, this is possible.

## Installation
You can install `fuso` via pip:

```bash
pip install fuso
```

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use `fuso` to merge two dictionaries:

```python
from fuso import merge

dict1 = {
    "settings": {
        "theme": "dark",
        "plugins": ["plugin1", "plugin2"]
    }
}
dict2 = {
    "settings": {
        "plugins": ["plugin3"],
        "language": "en"
    }
}
merged_dict = merge(dict1, dict2)
print(merged_dict)
# {
#    "settings": {
#      "theme": "dark",
#      "plugins": ["plugin1", "plugin2", "plugin3"],
#      "language": "en"
# }
```
