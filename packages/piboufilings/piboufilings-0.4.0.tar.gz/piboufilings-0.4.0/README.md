## Filing Contents at a Glance

Unlock structured, analysis-ready data from the SEC’s filings:

- **Filer Metadata:** Clean, machine-ready identifiers and attributes for every SEC registrant.
- **13F Holdings:** Quarter-by-quarter institutional portfolios — securities, CUSIPs, share counts, values, voting authority, and manager relationships.
- **N-PORT Fund Disclosures:** Monthly holdings for mutual funds and ETFs, enriched with fund/series metadata, balance-sheet items, and returns.
- **Section 16 (Forms 3/4/5):** Fully normalized insider trading data — filing metadata, issuer/owner links, transaction tables (non-derivative & derivative), prices, share amounts, and end-of-period holdings.


## Installation

```bash
pip install piboufilings
```

## Quick Start

The primary way to use `piboufilings` is with the `get_filings()` function:

```python
from piboufilings import get_filings

# Remember to replace with your actual email for the User-Agent
USER_AGENT_EMAIL = "yourname@example.com"
USER_NAME = "Your Name or Company"  # Add your name or company

get_filings(
    user_name=USER_NAME,
    user_agent_email=USER_AGENT_EMAIL,
    cik="0001067983",               # Berkshire Hathaway CIK; None: download all available data
    form_type=["13F-HR", "NPORT-P", "SECTION-6"],# String or list of strings
    start_year=2020,
    end_year=2025,
    base_dir="./my_sec_data",       # Optional: Custom directory for parsed CSVs
    log_dir="./my_sec_logs",        # Optional: Custom directory for logs
    raw_data_dir="./my_sec_raw_data",# Optional: Custom directory for raw filings
    keep_raw_files=True,            # Set to False to delete raw .txt files after parsing
    max_workers=5                   # Parallel workers for downloads/parsing
)
```

After running, parsed data will be written to `./my_sec_data` (or `./data_parsed` by default) and logs to `./my_sec_logs` (or `./logs`). Raw filings default to `./data_raw/<identifier>/<form>/<accession>/`; set `raw_data_dir` to place them elsewhere (e.g., `./my_sec_raw_data/<identifier>/<form>/<accession>/`).

CIK number can be obtained from [SEC EDGAR Search Filings](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings).

## Filing Structure & Identifiers
PibouFilings organizes EDGAR data around two key public identifiers:

*   **IRS_NUMBER:** The Employer Identification Number (EIN) issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. It uniquely identifies the legal entity submitting the filing.
*   **SEC_FILE_NUMBER:** The registration number assigned by the SEC. It distinguishes different types of filers and registrations (e.g., 028-xxxxx for 13F filers, 811-xxxxx for investment companies).

These two identifiers are public information, managed by U.S. federal agencies (IRS and SEC respectively), and act as the primary keys for organizing and indexing filings within PibouFilings.

### Filing Index
All parsed filings are first grouped by `IRS_NUMBER` and `SEC_FILE_NUMBER` into a structured index of registrants.

This allows you to track a fund or manager across multiple filings and time periods with full auditability.

### Holdings Reports
Each individual security holding (from 13F or N-PORT forms) is reported with a corresponding `SEC_FILE_NUMBER`.

This structure lets you link back any security-level data to the registered filing entity while keeping sensitive personal identifiers (e.g., signatory names) optional or excluded. When a filing discloses a CUSIP or similar identifier, it is preserved in the resulting CSVs so you can reconcile holdings downstream (see the legal notice below for usage requirements).

## Key Features

-   **Automated Downloads:** Fetch 13F, N-PORT, and Section 16 filings (via alias `SECTION-6`) by CIK, date range, or retrieve all available.
-   **Smart Parsing:**
    -   `Form13FParser`: Extracts detailed holdings and cover page data (including `IRS_NUMBER` and `SEC_FILE_NUMBER`) from 13F-HR filings.
    -   `FormNPORTParser`: Parses comprehensive fund/filer information (including `IRS_NUMBER` and `SEC_FILE_NUMBER`) and security holdings from N-PORT-P filings.
    -   `FormSection16Parser`: Normalizes Section 16 ownership XML (Forms 3/4/5) into filing-, transaction-, and holdings-level DataFrames (backed by the `sec16_*.csv` outputs).
-   **Structured CSV Output:**
    -   `13f_info.csv`: Filer information, summary fields, and a `SEC_FILING_URL` back to the original document.
    -   `13f_holdings.csv`: Aggregated holdings data from all processed 13F forms (including the reported CUSIP where available).
    -   `13f_other_managers_reporting.csv`: List of “other managers reporting for this manager” taken from each 13F cover page.
    -   `13f_other_included_managers.csv`: Detailed mapping of numbered “other included managers” so holdings can be joined back to the entities referenced in the table footers.
    -   `nport_filing_info.csv`: Fund/filer information and summaries for N-PORT forms.
    -   `nport_holdings.csv`: Aggregated holdings data from all processed N-PORT forms (includes CUSIP where provided).
    -   `sec16_info.csv`: Filing-level metadata plus issuer/reporting-owner identifiers and role flags for Forms 3/4/5 (alias `SECTION-6`).
    -   `sec16_transactions.csv`: Line-item insider transactions (non-derivative and derivative tables), including codes, dates, share amounts, prices, and post-transaction balances.
    -   `sec16_holdings.csv`: End-of-period holdings snapshots from the Section 16 tables, aligned with issuer and owner identifiers.
-   **Robust EDGAR Interaction:**
    -   Adheres to SEC rate limits (10 req/sec) via a configurable global token bucket rate limiter.
    -   Comprehensive retry mechanism for network requests (handles connection errors, read errors, and specific HTTP status codes like 429, 5xx).
-   **Efficient & Configurable:**
    -   Parallelized downloads using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for faster processing of CIKs with multiple filings.
    -   Option to `keep_raw_files` (default True) or delete them after processing.
    -   Customizable directories for data and logs.
-   **Detailed Logging:**
    -   Records operations to a daily CSV log file (e.g., `logs/filing_operations_YYYYMMDD.csv`).
    -   Logs include timestamps, descriptive `operation_type` (e.g., `DOWNLOAD_SINGLE_FILING_SUCCESS`), CIK, accession number, success/failure status, error messages, and specific `error_code` (like HTTP status codes) where applicable.
-   **Data Analytics Ready:** Pandas DataFrames are used internally and for the final CSV outputs.
-   **Handles Amendments:** Automatically processes and correctly identifies amended filings (e.g., `13F-HR/A`, `NPORT-P/A`).
