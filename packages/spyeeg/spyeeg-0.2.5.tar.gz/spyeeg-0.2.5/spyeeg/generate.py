    Generate an arbitrary time series representing a continuous stimuli. This can be done using either

        The sampling frequency of the signal, in Hz.
    time_array : ndarray
        The different timesteps, typically a range from 0 to N-1 for N timepoints.

    """
    Simulate M/sE/EEG channels as the combination of responses to arbitrary features and noise. 
    This supposedly models a linear time invariant system, considering noise as every process other than 
    the one in response to the stimuli. There is the possibility to change the number of channels, the
    general shape and weights of impulse responses corresponding to different features, noise color and amplitude, 
    as well as to add a non-linear compression factor.
    The impulse responses are all in the forms of a sine wave with an exponential decay, shifted in time.
    This functions returns the timepoints, features, channels and impulse responses.
    
    Parameters:
        n_feat (int): The number of features of the stimuli.
        n_channels (int): The number of channels to simulate.
        fs (float): The sampling frequency, in Hz.
        T (float): The duration of the signal to simulate, in s.
        snd_db (float): The signal to noise, in dB. If equal to 0
        beta_noise (float): The parameter used in noise generation. 
                            if 0, equivalent to pure white noise.
                            if 1, equivalent to pure pink noise.
        stim_type (str): whether to use discrete or continuous features. must be either 'discrete' or 'continuous'.
        n_pulse (int): In the case of discrete features, the number of events to consider.
        share_events (bool): Whether different features are related to the same set of events.
        weights_feat (list): List of weights attributed to different features.
        weights_channel (list): List of weights, i.e. signal strength, on different channels. These are the same for every features.
        compression_factor (float): Exponent factor linking feature and impulse response. 
                                    This is used to test the effect of the linearity assumption violation.
        impulse_freqs (list): Minimum and maximum frequency possible for the frequency of the impulse response.
        decreasing_rates (list): Minimum and maximum exponential decay of the impulse response.
        delays (list): Minimum and maximum delays to shift the impulse response by. 
                       Postive values mean the brain response happen AFTER the stimuli, which is the causal direction.
                       Negative values could be interpreted as a prediction from the brain.
        filter_impulse (bool): Whether to filter the neural data.
        filter_val (list): Low pass and high-pass values of the filter to apply.
        share_impulse (bool): Whether different channels respond to the stimuli with the same impulse.
                              Typically True for EEG as channels share common signals. 
                              Depending on implantation, this could not be the case sEEG for example.
        random seed (int): Random seed.
        scale_data (bool): Whether to z-scores the data. 
        
    Returns:
        time_array (np.ndarray): Array of timepoints.
        X (np.ndarray): Feature/Stimuli matrix.
        Y (np.ndarray): Neural data matrix.
