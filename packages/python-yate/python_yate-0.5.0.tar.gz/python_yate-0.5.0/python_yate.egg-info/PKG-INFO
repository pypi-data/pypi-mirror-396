# Python support for yate-pbx

This package implements library support for the external module protocol used
by the yate pbx. There is support for the basic wire protocol and higher level
abstractions using asyncio - including special support for IVRs (interactive voice
response) systems.

# Examples

Have a look at the examples folder to see how to use the IVR support library.

Moreover, there is a call generator example in the tools folder.
