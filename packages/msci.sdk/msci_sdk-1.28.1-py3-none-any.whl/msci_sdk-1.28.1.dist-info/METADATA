MSCI SDK Introduction
=====================

The MSCI Python SDK provides easy-to-use Python libraries that enable users to easily access and use MSCI APIs, content, and data into their own choice of platform.

The current version of the MSCI Python SDK provides access to the MSCI Optimization Service API, which is offered as part of MSCI Quantitative Investment Solutions (QIS). You can use the API to:

* upload user portfolios and tax lots in JSON format
* create tax aware optimization strategies
* retrieve statistics to evaluate performance of the strategy
* customize portfolios with various optimization methodologies

For more information about the MSCI Optimization Service API, see https://support.msci.com/msci-optimization-service.

Documentation

Installation
=============

.. code-block:: python

    pip install msci.sdk
    
    
Example
=======

Tax Optimization of portfolio using msci.sdk library. It demonstrates connection to the API, tax lot upload, rebalance, trade list generation, and review of results.

To download below example as notebook, kindly refer https://developer.msci.com/code-libraries/qis-tax-optimization-with-msci-sdk-python-notebooks


.. code-block:: python

    from msci.sdk.calc.portfolio import mos
    import pandas as pd

    # 1. Connect to the MOS API

    session = mos.MOSSession()
    session.ping()

    # 2. Load a portfolio using tax lots
    sample_data = pd.DataFrame([{"openTradeDate": "2016-12-30", "ISIN": "US02079K3059", "quantity": 1000, "openCostBasis": 792.45, "Asset Name": "ALPHABET INC"},
                                {"openTradeDate": "2016-12-30", "ISIN": "US0231351067", "quantity": 450, "openCostBasis": 749.87, "Asset Name": "AMAZON.COM INC"},
                                {"openTradeDate": "2016-12-30", "ISIN": "US30303M1027", "quantity": 900, "openCostBasis": 115.05, "Asset Name": "FACEBOOK INC"}])

    portfolio = session.upload_taxlot_portfolio(
        portfolio_id='MyTaxLotPortfolio', as_of_date='2021-12-31', asset_id='ISIN', taxlot_df=sample_data)

    # 3. Run the rebalance using the preferred strategy
    mytemplate = mos.TaxAdvantagedModelTrackingTemplate(analysis_date='2022-01-03',portfolio=portfolio)

    # 4. Executing the MSCI Optimizer session
    job = session.execute(profile=mytemplate)

    # Wait for the results to come back
    job.wait()

    # 5. Show the portfolio level results
    job.get_valuations()

    # Fetching the optimizer result
    opt_result = job.optimizer_result()

    # Portfolio Summary
    opt_result.get_portfolio_summary_detail()

    # Display portfolio and trade suggestions
    job.rebalanced_portfolio_on('2022-01-03')
    job.trade_suggestions_on('2022-01-03')
