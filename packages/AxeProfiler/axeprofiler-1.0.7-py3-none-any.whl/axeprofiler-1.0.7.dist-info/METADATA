## Requirements
* [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.11
  * requests >= 2.32.5
  * rich >= 14.2.0

## Installation
### [The Way of the Plebb]
Coming soon... ⌛

### [The Way of the Dev]
Clone the repo and run `pip install -e .` from the project root directory. This
should install all dependencies and add the `axeprof` command to PATH - allowing
you to call the program from anywhere with that pip environment active.
```
(venv) <axeprofiler_directory>$ pip install -e .
(venv) $ axeprof
```

You can also install the package from PYPI
```
(venv) $ python -m pip install axeprofiler
(venv) $ axeprof
```
Once installed, you may also start the program from inside a python REPL by
importing the entry-point function.
```
>>> # inside python REPL
>>> from axeprofiler.__main__ import main
>>> main()
```
## Notes
* This project is still in active development, and it's possible a few hidden
bugs linger (though, they are actively hunted down).
* While there are confirmation prompts, please do your due diligence to know
which device (IP) you are applying a profile to.
* Deleting a [selected] profile does not remove the configuration from an active
miner running it.
