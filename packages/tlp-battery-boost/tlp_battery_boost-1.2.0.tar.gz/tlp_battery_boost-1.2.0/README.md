_A lightweight Tkinter GUI to toggle TLP’s battery-care charging thresholds, allowing quick switching between
configured battery-health limits and a temporary full-charge override (`tlp fullcharge`)._

## Overview

**TLP Battery Boost** simplifies [TLP's](https://linrunner.de/tlp/) battery-care workflow. It is particularly
convenient for users who prefer to preserve battery health but occasionally need a full charge.

It provides a simple GUI to:

- View the laptop’s battery thresholds and charge status.
- Temporarily override charge thresholds using Full Charge (`tlp fullcharge`).
- Revert to normal battery-care behaviour with a single click.

## Features

- **Toggle Charging Behaviour:** Switch between configured battery-care thresholds and full-charge override.
- **Automatic Authentication:** Enter your password once - the app maintains sudo privileges while running.
- **Battery Status Display:** View current charge levels and threshold settings.
- **Theme Support:** Choose between light and dark themes.
- **Adjustable Font Sizes:** Scale the interface to your preference.
- **Terminal Integration:** When launched from a terminal, status messages are also printed to stdout.

## Requirements

- Linux with TLP installed and configured
- Python 3.10+
- Tkinter (`python3-tk`)
- sudo privileges for TLP commands

## Installation

**Ensure TLP and Tkinter are installed on your system:**

```bash
sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw python3-tk  # For Debian/Ubuntu
# or
sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw python3-tkinter  # For Fedora
```

**Installing with pipx (Recommended)**

```bash
pipx install tlp-battery-boost
```

**Optional Desktop Integration**

If you’d like Battery Boost to appear in your system’s application menu or on your desktop:

- Most Linux desktop environments (such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE) allow you to **add a custom launcher** manually.
- Set the command to `battery_boost` and (optionally) include options such as `battery_boost -t dark -f 2`.

**Example `.desktop` File**

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Battery Boost
Exec=battery_boost
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/BatteryBoost.png
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;HardwareSettings;
Comment=Toggle TLP fullcharge mode
Terminal=false
```

## Usage

To launch the graphical interface:

```bash
battery_boost
```

When launched the app will:

- Prompt for your sudo password.
- Initialise TLP to default settings.
- Show the current battery status.
- Provide a button to toggle between battery-care thresholds and full-charge override.


## Command Line Options

You can view the full command-line options by running:

```bash
battery_boost --help
```

Example output:

```text
battery_boost --help
usage: battery_boost [-h] [-v] [-f {1-5}] [-t {light,dark}]

A simple GUI to enable `tlp fullcharge`.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -f {1-5}, --font-size {1-5}
                        Font size [1-5] (1=smallest, 5=largest) (default: 3)
  -t {light,dark}, --theme {light,dark}
                        Color theme (default: light)
```

**Notes:**

- `-f` sets the font size (1=smallest, 5=largest; default=3).  
- `-t` sets the colour theme (light or dark; default=light).  
- `-v` prints the program version.  
- `-h` shows this help message and exits.


### Examples

**Large font with dark theme**

```
battery_boost -f 5 -t dark
```
 
**Small font for compact displays**

```
battery_boost --font-size 1
```

## How It Works

- **Battery-Care Mode:** Uses TLP’s configured battery-preservation charge thresholds. For example: 
  - **Start threshold** = 70%: The laptop will only start charging when the battery is below 70%.
  - **End threshold** = 80%: The laptop will stop charging when the battery reaches the 80% limit.
- **Full Charge Mode:** Temporarily disables charge limits to charge the battery to 100%.
- **Authentication:** Caches sudo credentials to avoid repeated password prompts.
- **Status Monitoring:** Uses `tlp-stat -b` to display current battery thresholds and charge levels.

**Note:** After the laptop is rebooted, TLP returns to its normal threshold-controlled behaviour.

## Security Notes

Authentication is managed by `sudo`, and the temporary variable holding the password is cleared
(reference removed) immediately after authentication.

- Your password is only used for initial sudo authentication.
- Your password is never logged, transmitted, or written to disk.
- `sudo` privileges are revoked on exit using `sudo --remove-timestamp`.
- No network connections are made - everything runs locally.

## Troubleshooting

**Tkinter not available / ImportError: No module named 'tkinter':**

- Make sure Tkinter is installed (see the Installation section above).  
- On Linux, this usually requires the system package `python3-tk` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `python3-tkinter` (Fedora).

**TLP not found error:**

- Ensure TLP is installed and in your PATH.
- Verify TLP is properly configured for your system.

```bash
# Verify TLP works as expected:
sudo tlp-stat -b
# Try starting tlp manually:
sudo tlp start
```

**Authentication issues:**

- Make sure you have sudo privileges.
- Check that your password is correct.

**Battery status not showing:**

- Verify your system's battery is detected by TLP.
- Check that `sudo tlp-stat -b` works from the command line.
