# API How to:

- Visit https://developer.brawlstars.com

- Sign in, and click my account.

- Make a new api key, give it a name, description and YOUR IP ADDRESS. Whether that be your server IP or your computer IP. If you're doing this, I'm sure you can find out your IP address. Or just use https://whatismyipaddress.com. 

Any who, do what you want. I'll try my best to keep it up to date. It's open source after all lol
