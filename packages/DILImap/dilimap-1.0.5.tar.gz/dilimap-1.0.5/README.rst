DILImap & ToxPredictor
======================

**DILImap** is a pioneering toxicogenomics atlas purpose-built for modeling Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI).
It features RNA-seq profiles from primary human hepatocytes exposed to 300 diverse compounds. It offers a powerful foundation for mechanistic insight and predictive modeling.

**ToxPredictor**, trained on DILImap, sets a new benchmark in DILI risk assessment. With 88% sensitivity at 100% specificity,
it outperforms traditional methods and reliably flags even the most elusive DILI-prone drugs, including withdrawn and idiosyncratic compounds.

**Publication**: `Bergen et al. (2025) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-65690-3>`_
