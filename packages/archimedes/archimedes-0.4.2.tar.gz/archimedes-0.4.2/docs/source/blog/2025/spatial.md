**_Inside the new `spatial` module_**

Jared Callaham • 16 Oct 2025 (Updated 5 Nov 2025)

<!-- Graphic: 6dof gimbal with graduation cap -->

Release v0.3.1 marks the graduation of the [`spatial`](#archimedes.spatial) module out of experimental status and into production.
This module includes core functionality for 3D vehicle dynamics modeling in a range of domains.

In this post we'll introduce the most important members of this module: the [`Attitude`](#archimedes.spatial.Attitude) protocol and [`RigidBody`](#archimedes.spatial.RigidBody) class.
These let you represent 3D rotations and 6dof rigid body dynamics in a way that's extensible, customizable, and compatible with the rest of Archimedes, including C code generation, autodiff, and tree operations.

We'll cover:

- Why you might want to use the `spatial` module
- Attitude representations and the `Attitude` protocol
- 6dof dynamics and the `RigidBody` class
- Building your own vehicle models
- What's next for `spatial`

:::{note}
This post serves as an announcement of these new features, but will also be updated to provide a basic reference for the relevant conventions and equations. **Most recent update: 5 Nov 2025 (v0.4.0)**
:::

## What `spatial` Does

The [`spatial`](#archimedes.spatial) module is designed for _cross-domain spatial mechanics_.
This means that there's no specific physics modeling like aerodynamics or gravity, but there are reusable components that come in handy across a wide range of application areas; satellites, airplanes, rockets, drones, watercraft, and cars can all use the same basic spatial dynamics primitives.

The module is built on two main capabilities: **3D rotation representations**, and **6dof rigid body dynamics**.
We'll cover these next.

### What's not in `spatial`

This module does not (yet) handle any multibody dynamics - RNA, CRB, contact mechanics, etc. - although this is on the longer-term [roadmap](../../roadmap.md).

Much sooner on the roadmap, `spatial` will eventually add functionality for _spatial transforms_ combining translation and rotation, plus _kinematic tree_ data structures to handle complex and moving reference frame situations (common in robotics and orbital mechanics, for instance).

In short, the current functionality is useful for 3D orientations and when simulating isolated rigid bodies in 3D (especially vehicle dynamics), but not for full-fledged multibody systems including joints and collisions.

## TL; DR

Here's a "quickstart" version of the capabilities in `spatial`.

First, working with attitudes and rotations:

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [remove-cell]
# ruff: noqa: N803, N806, N816
```

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np

import archimedes as arc
from archimedes.spatial import Attitude, EulerAngles, Quaternion, RigidBody

# Define a roll-pitch-yaw sequence representing the attitude of body B with respect
# to inertial earth frame E
rpy = EulerAngles([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], seq="xyz")

# Convert to a rotation matrix that transforms vectors from frame E to frame B
R_BE = rpy.as_matrix()
v_E = np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0])
v_B = R_BE @ v_E

# Inverse transformation
v_E = R_BE.T @ v_B

# Convert between representations
q = rpy.as_quat()

# Same operations in either representation
R_BE = q.as_matrix()
v_B = R_BE @ v_E
```

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [remove-cell]

assert np.allclose(rpy.as_matrix() @ v_E, q.as_matrix() @ v_E)
```

6-dof rigid body dynamics:

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [hide-output]
# Rigid body dynamics
t = 0
x = RigidBody.State(
    pos=np.zeros(3),  # Inertial position
    att=rpy,
    v_B=np.array([10.0, 0.0, 0.0]),  # Body-frame velocity
    w_B=np.zeros(3),  # Body-frame angular velocity
)
u = RigidBody.Input(
    F_B=np.array([0.0, 0.0, 10.0]),  # Body-frame forces
    M_B=np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0]),  # Body-frame moments
    m=10.0,  # Mass
    J_B=np.eye(3),  # Inertia matrix
)
x_t = RigidBody.dynamics(t, x, u)  # Calculate time derivatives

# Can use either attitude representation
x = x.replace(att=q)
x_t = RigidBody.dynamics(t, x, u)  # Automatically uses quaternion kinematics
```

This works because the `Attitude` protocol lets you write type-safe "polymorphic" functions that work with any attitude representation (basically, fancy old school duck-typing):

```{code-cell} python
def body_frame_kinematics(
    att: Attitude, v_B: np.ndarray, w_B: np.ndarray
) -> tuple[np.ndarray, Attitude]:
    R_EB = att.as_matrix().T
    pos_deriv = R_EB @ v_B  # Inertial-frame velocity
    att_deriv = att.kinematics(w_B)  # Attitude kinematics
    return pos_deriv, att_deriv


v_B = np.array([10.0, 0.0, 0.0])
w_B = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0])
dp_E, drpy = body_frame_kinematics(rpy, v_B, w_B)  # Euler kinematics
dp_E, dq = body_frame_kinematics(q, v_B, w_B)  # Quaternion kinematics
```

That's basically all you need to know to start working with `spatial`, but read on for a deeper dive.

## 3D Rotations

Direction cosine matrices, Euler angles, and quaternions are all representations of 3D rotations - how one frame or body is oriented relative to another in space.
Archimedes represents these rotations using the [`Attitude`](#archimedes.spatial.Attitude) protocol and classes that implement this abstract interface, most importantly [`EulerAngles`](#archimedes.spatial.EulerAngles) and [`Quaternion`](#archimedes.spatial.Quaternion).

The `Attitude` interface is largely patterned on [SciPy's `Rotation` class](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html), but deviates from SciPy in several ways that make it more convenient for flexible dynamics modeling.

:::{note}
**Active and Passive Rotations:** Archimedes adopts a passive rotation convention for coordinate frame transformations.
This differs for example from SciPy's active rotation convention, which rotates vectors in a single coordinate frame.
The rotation matrices used in either cases are transposes of each other.
:::

### Active and passive rotations

There are at least three ways to think about a "3D rotation":

1. The orientation of a body B relative to frame A (e.g. the roll-pitch-yaw sequence you would apply to reach the current attitude)
2. A coordinate transformation from a vector from frame A to frame B
3. An SO(3) rotation transformation applied to a vector

The first two are mathematically equivalent and are inverse to the third.
The first two represent a change of coordinates of a fixed "abstract" vector; the numbers in the array change, but they represent the same physical quantity (e.g. a force or velocity).
This is by convention called a "passive" rotation since the vector itself doesn't change.

The third case represents a transformation of the vector itself in a single coordinate system.
In this case the vector moves, and so the rotation is called "active".

For example, if we have an aircraft that is at a roll angle $\phi$, we might want to know what the force of gravity is in body-fixed coordinates.
In the North-East-Down "earth" frame E, gravity is

```{math}
\mathbf{F}_g^E = mg_0 \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
```

To get the body-frame gravity vector we apply a rotation
$\mathbf{R}_{BE}$ defined by the attitude of the vehicle:

```{math}
\mathbf{F}_g^B = \mathbf{R}_{BE}(\phi) \mathbf{F}_g^E = m g_0 \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \sin \phi & \cos \phi \end{bmatrix}.
```

In code, this looks like:

```python
F_grav_E = np.array([0, 0, m*g0])
R_BE = EulerAngles(phi, "x").as_matrix()
F_grav_B = R_BE @ F_grav_E
```

This is a _passive_ rotation because the force vector is the same; the coordinates are what rotate.
This is a more common situation in physics and engineering, where vectors are physical quantities that we express in various convenient coordinate systems.
**The "passive" interpretation is the default in Archimedes**

On the other hand, suppose we have a mesh with $N$ vertices defined by a `(3, N)` array and we want to visualize this at a roll angle of $\phi$.
One way to look at this situation is that the vertices are defined in a "body" coordinate system (the original mesh coordinates), and the "earth" coordinate system is what the graphing library will use.
In this case the transformation we need is $\mathbf{R}_EB = \mathbf{R}_BE^T$, which will go from the body frame B to the world frame E.

Alternatively, we could view this as an "active" rotation of the vertex points to the new orientation; in either case $\mathbf{R}_EB$ is the correct transformation.

In code, this is the inverse transformation:

```python
R_EB = EulerAngles(phi, "x").as_matrix().T
p_E = R_EB @ p_B  # (3, N)
```

This kind of "active" transformation is more common in computer graphics and is taken as the default interpretation of a "rotation" in SciPy, for example.
**The key thing to remember is that Archimedes treats the vector as a frame-independent physical quantity and rotates the _coordinates_, not the vector itself.**
However, as seen in the previous code snippet, the "active" behavior can be recovered by simply inverting the transformation.

### The `Attitude` protocol

The interface expected by rotation representations is defined by an [`Attitude`](#archimedes.spatial.Attitude) protocol that looks like the following:

```python
class Attitude(Protocol):
    def as_matrix(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """Convert the attitude to a direction cosine matrix (DCM)"""
    
    def rotate(self, vectors: np.ndarray, inverse: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:
        """Rotate vectors with the transformation represented by the attitude"""

    def inv(self) -> Attitude:
        """Compute the inverse of the rotation corresponding to the attitude."""

    def kinematics(self, w_B: np.ndarray) -> Attitude:
        """Compute the time derivative of the attitude given angular velocity."""
```

The two current implementations of this protocol are [`EulerAngles`](#archimedes.spatial.EulerAngles) and [`Quaternion`](#archimedes.spatial.Quaternion), both of which additionally support indexing, iteration, and conversions back and forth.

This design departs from SciPy's `Rotation` class, which always uses an quaternion representation internally but has flexible constructor methods (`from_euler`) and conversion to arrays (`as_euler`).
The difficulty with this for dynamics modeling is that quaternions are not _always_ the best choice.
Quaternions are a good default, since they provide a minimal, singularity-free representation of 3D rotations, but Euler angles are more intuitive for applications like stability analysis of flight dynamics and when working with vehicles like cars that are unlikely to reach gimbal lock.
Additionally, some specialized applications like trajectory optimization might use representations like modified Rodrigues parameters that do not require the unit-norm constraint of quaternions.

What the `Attitude` protocol buys us is _polymorphism_.
You can write code that accepts an `Attitude` and expect to use any of the methods above safely, regardless of what the representation is.
For example, the position and attitude kinematics calculation in `RigidBody` looks roughly like:

```python
def kinematics(
    att: Attitude, v_B: np.ndarray, w_B: np.ndarray
) -> tuple[np.ndarray, Attitude]:
    R_EB = att.as_matrix().T
    pos_deriv = R_EB @ v_B  # Inertial-frame velocity
    att_deriv = att.kinematics(w_B)  # Attitude kinematics
    return pos_deriv, att_deriv
```

This function will work for _any_ class that properly implements the `Attitude` spec, meaning that you can freely swap between Euler angles, quaternions, custom attitude parameterizations, etc. without any reconfiguration or special handling.

### Quaternions

The [`Quaternion`](#archimedes.spatial.Quaternion) implementation closely follows [SciPy's `Rotation`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html) and is unit tested directly against the SciPy behavior.
However, by re-implementing it in Archimedes we can ensure that it is compatible with the `Attitude` spec as well as all of the symbolic-numeric capabilities like autodiff and codegen.

```{code-cell} python
# Rotate a vector from the inertial earth frame E to the body frame B if the body's
# attitude is given by (roll, pitch, yaw) Euler angles rpy
def to_body(rpy, v_E):
    att = Quaternion.from_euler(rpy, seq="xyz")
    R_EB = att.as_matrix()
    return R_EB @ v_E


rpy = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
v_E = np.array([10.0, 0.0, 0.0])
print(arc.jac(to_body)(rpy, v_E))  # dv_E/drpy
```

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [remove-cell]
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as ScipyRotation

v_B_arc = to_body(rpy, v_E)
v_B_sp = ScipyRotation.from_euler("xyz", rpy).apply(v_E, inverse=True)
assert np.allclose(v_B_sp, v_B_arc)
```

As with the SciPy implementation, a `Quaternion` can be instantiated from a rotation matrix (DCM), another quaternion, or any combination of Euler angles, giving you a lot of flexibility in how you think about representing your attitude while still providing a robust representation of 3D rotations.

:::{note}
Another difference from the SciPy version is that by default Archimedes uses a scalar-first component ordering, more common in engineering applications compared to, for instance, computer graphics.
:::

Archimedes also diverges from SciPy by implementing the `Attitude` interface; namely, by providing a `kinematics` method that calculates quaternion kinematics, assuming the rotation represents the orientation of a moving body with respect to some reference frame.
Given the angular velocity of the body in its own frame, $\omega_B$, this function calculates the time derivative of the rotation using quaternion kinematics:

```{math}
\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{q} \otimes \boldsymbol{\omega}^B
```

The actual implementation of quaternion kinematics differs slightly from the ideal form by adding a "Baumgarte stabilization" to numerically preserve the unit-norm requirement.
With a stabilization factor of $\lambda$, the full kinematics model is:

```{math}
\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{q} \otimes \boldsymbol{\omega}^B - \lambda * (||\mathbf{q}||² - 1) \mathbf{q}.
```

A factor of $\lambda = 1$ is a good default (and is the default in `RigidBody` as well).

```{code-cell} python
att = Quaternion.from_euler(rpy, "xyz")
w_B = np.array([0.0, 0.1, 0.0])  # 0.1 rad/sec pitch-up
att.kinematics(w_B)
```

:::{caution}
The `kinematics` method returns the time derivative of the `Quaternion` as a new `Quaternion` instance.
This is convenient for working with ODE solvers and other algorithms that expect the output to have the same structure as the input state.
However, keep in mind that the time derivative $\dot{\mathbf{q}}$ is _not_ itself a valid rotation.
Hence, you CANNOT use `att.kinematics(w_B).as_euler("xyz")` to get the Euler angle rates.
If you need Euler rates, use Euler kinematics directly: `att.as_euler("xyz").kinematics(w_B)`.
:::

This attitude kinematics calculation comes in particularly handy for the second major functionality released with `spatial`: 6dof rigid body dynamics modeling.

### Euler angles

The [`EulerAngles`](#archimedes.spatial.EulerAngles) class has a similar interface to [`Quaternion`](#archimedes.spatial.Quaternion), differing mainly in construction and interpretation.

The class allows you to specify a sequence `seq` of rotation axes as a string of 1-3 letters `'x'`, `'y'`, and `'z'`.
These are interpreted as sequential rotations about each axis to go from a "parent" or "world" frame to the body frame specified by the attitude.
For example, the typical roll-pitch-yaw sequence for vehicle dynamics is specified by `seq="xyz"` and is interpreted as a right-handed rotation about the world-frame $x$-axis, followed by a rotation about the _new_ $y$-axis and finally a rotation about the subsequent $z$-axis.

:::{note}
`EulerAngles` supports "intrinsic" rotations (use upper-case letters, as in the SciPy convention), but here we'll mostly discuss the "extrinsic" convention with lower-case axis sequences.
:::

Mathematically, `EulerAngles(rpy, seq="xyz").as_matrix()` produces the following matrix, representing a coordinate transform from "earth frame" E to "body frame" B with `rpy` a 3-element array of roll $\phi$, pitch $\theta$, and yaw $\psi$:

```{math}
R_BE(\phi, \theta, \psi) = R_z(\psi) R_y(\theta) R_x(\psi)
```

This sequence can be used to flexibly represent a variety of coordinate transformations, for instance:

```python
# Simple rotation about a single axis from A -> B
R_BA = EulerAngles(theta, "z")

# Standard roll-pitch-yaw sequence
R_BE = EulerAngles(rpy, seq="xyz")

# Rotation from wind frame W with (α, β) to body frame B
R_BW = EulerAngles([-beta, alpha], seq="zy")

# Rotation from ECI frame to perifocal in orbital mechanics
R_PE = EulerAngles([ω, i, Ω], "zxz")
```

The `EulerAngles` representation can easily be converted to/from other representations like `Quaternion`, or betweeen sequences:

```{code-cell} python
rpy = EulerAngles([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], seq="xyz")
q = rpy.as_quat()  # Quaternion([0.98334744 0.0342708  0.10602051 0.14357218])
ypr = rpy.as_euler("zyx")  # EulerAngles([0.2857717  0.22012403 0.03787988], seq='zyx')
```

For the Euler-to-Euler conversion, note that the `as_euler(seq)` requires a sequence of exactly three non-repeating axes in order to guarantee a complete representation in the output.
That is, `rpy.as_euler("x")` will raise an error since this is mathematically undefined.

Finally, `EulerAngles` implements Euler kinematics _for the roll-pitch-yaw sequence `"xyz"` only_.
This converts body-frame angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}^B$ to Euler angle rates:

```{code-cell} python
rpy = EulerAngles([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], seq="xyz")
w_B = np.array([0.0, 0.1, 0.0])  # Angular velocity
drpy_dt = rpy.kinematics(w_B)
```

:::{caution}
As with `Quaternion.kinematics`, the `EulerAngles.kinematics`method returns the time derivative of the `EulerAngles` as a new `EulerAngles` instance.
This is convenient for working with ODE solvers and other algorithms that expect the output to have the same structure as the input state.
However, keep in mind that the time derivative of the Euler angles are not themselves a valid rotation representation.
In almost all cases, the only thing you should do with the Euler rates is integrate them to get the time series of angles.
:::

### Low-level rotation API

If the `Attitude` system isn't your thing and you prefer an interface closer to MATLAB's Aerospace Toolbox - or if you want to implement your own system for attitude and rotation representation - there are also lower-level functions that operate directly on arrays.

The low-level functions are:

- [`euler_to_quaternion`](#archimedes.spatial.euler_to_quaternion)
- [`euler_to_dcm`](#archimedes.spatial.euler_to_dcm)
- [`quaternion_to_euler`](#archimedes.spatial.quaternion_to_euler)
- [`euler_kinematics`](#archimedes.spatial.euler_kinematics)
- [`quaternion_to_dcm`](#archimedes.spatial.quaternion_to_dcm)
- [`dcm_to_quaternion`](#archimedes.spatial.dcm_to_quaternion)
- [`quaternion_inverse`](#archimedes.spatial.quaternion_inverse)
- [`quaternion_multiply`](#archimedes.spatial.quaternion_multiply)
- [`quaternion_kinematics`](#archimedes.spatial.quaternion_kinematics)

Each of these do exactly what they sound like - see the docstrings for details.

These functions are called by wrapper classes like `Quaternion` and `EulerAngles` for conversions and kinematics, so you get the same behavior and performance either way - it's just a matter of which interface you prefer.

## 6dof Dynamics

A "6dof" rigid body has three translational and three rotational "degrees of freedom" from the point of view of Lagrangian mechanics.
From a state-space modeling perspective, this system has either 12 or 13 dynamical states (depending on whether you use Euler or quaternion kinematics).
The rigid body dynamics model implements the equations of motion of such a body given specified forces, torques, and mass/inertia characteristics.

The Archimedes [`RigidBody`](#archimedes.spatial.RigidBody) implementation follows the conventions of the classic GNC textbook ["Aircraft Control and Simulation"](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119174882) by Stevens, Lewis, and Johnson.
Hence, the terminology and implementation is heavily based on flight dynamics applications, though this can be adapted straightforwardly to other domains.
For an in-depth description of the conventions, notation, and derivation of the equations of motion, refer to the textbook.

Our rigid body model assumes two reference frames: a body-fixed frame "B" with the origin at the center of mass, and a Newtonian inertial frame "N" (for instance the world or ground frame in flight dynamics).

```{image} _static/spatial_frames_light.png
:class: only-light
```

```{image} _static/spatial_frames_dark.png
:class: only-dark
```

Vectors are suffixed following [monogram notation](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation__basics.html) to indicate coordinate systems unless it is clear.
In this convention, the dynamical states for a rigid body are four vectors:

- `pos`: the position of the body in the inertial frame ($\mathbf{p}^N$)
- `att`: the attitude of the body with respect to the inertial frame
- `v_B`: the translational velocity of the body in its own coordinate system B ($\mathbf{v}^B$)
- `w_B`: the body-relative angular velocity vector ($\boldsymbol{\omega}^B$)

The governing equations for these four state components depend on the applied forces and moments in the body frame ($\mathbf{F}^B$ and $\mathbf{M}^B$, respectively), as well as on the mass $m$ and inertia matrix $J_B$ of the vehicle.
If the mass and/or inertia matrix are changing significantly in time, their time derivatives can also be provided (we'll ignore this here, since this is uncommon).

Then the equations of motion are:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{p}}^N &= \mathbf{R}_{BN}^T(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{v}^B \\
\dot{\mathbf{q}} &= \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{q} \otimes \boldsymbol{\omega}^B - \lambda * (||\mathbf{q}||^2 - 1) \mathbf{q} \\
\dot{\mathbf{v}}^B &= \frac{1}{m}\mathbf{F}^B - \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times \mathbf{v}^B \\
\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^B &= \mathbf{J}_B^{-1}(\mathbf{M}^B - \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times (\mathbf{J}_B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B))
\end{align*}
```

:::{note}
The choice to use body-frame rather than inertial velocity may be surprising, given that the evolution equation then requires the non-inertial term $\boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times \mathbf{v}^B$.
This is done for two reasons.
First, in many applications forces are more naturally expressed in body-frame coordinates, so working with body-frame velocities avoids an extra rotation (though integrating velocity to position requires the rotation anyway, so this is basically a wash).
More importantly, choosing to represent both the translational and angular velocity in the body frame is consistent with ["Plücker coordinates"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates), which will become the common representation of motion and forces as the `spatial` module grows to encompass multibody dynamics (think recursive Newton-Euler, composite rigid body, etc.).
For more, see ["Looking Ahead"](#looking-ahead) below - and don't worry, if you've never heard of Plücker coordinates you won't need to learn them to use this module.
:::

The `RigidBody` class exists to calculate these equations for a generic body - you just have to provide forces, moments, mass, and inertia characteristics. 
The idea is that you can use this as a building block and construct your own vehicle models (or models of whatever it is you're building) by implementing the domain-specific physics models and letting Archimedes handle the generic parts.

### Implementation

The `RigidBody` class structure looks roughly like the following:

```python
@struct
class RigidBody:
    rpy_attitude: bool = False  # If True, use roll-pitch-yaw for attitude
    baumgarte: float = 1.0  # Baumgarte stabilization factor for quaternion kinematics

    @struct
    class State:
        pos: np.ndarray  # Position of the center of mass in the Newtonian frame N
        att: Rotation | np.ndarray  # Attitude (orientation) of the vehicle
        v_B: np.ndarray  # Velocity of the center of mass in body frame B
        w_B: np.ndarray  # Angular velocity in body frame (ω_B)

    @struct
    class Input:
        F_B: np.ndarray  # Net forces in body frame B
        M_B: np.ndarray  # Net moments in body frame B
        m: float  # mass [kg]
        J_B: np.ndarray  # inertia matrix [kg·m²]
        dm_dt: float = 0.0  # mass rate of change [kg/s]
        # inertia rate of change [kg·m²/s]
        dJ_dt: np.ndarray = field(default_factory=lambda: np.zeros((3, 3)))  # type: ignore


    def dynamics(self, t: float, x: State, u: Input) -> State:
        ...
```

See the [source code](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/blob/main/src/archimedes/spatial/_rigid_body.py) for the actual implementation.

The inner classes `State` and `Input` help to organize the data and states, and the `dynamics` method does the work of actually calculating the equations of motion as given above.

:::{note}
**On time-varying mass/inertia**: it is relatively common to have vehicles that change mass and inertia properties over time (e.g. a rocket burning fuel).
`RigidBody` takes these as inputs so that you can manage their characteristics however you want.
Technically, when the mass and inertia are time-varying this adds terms like $\dot{m} v_B$ to the dynamics equations.
Under most circumstances these contributions are negligible even if $\dot{m} \neq 0$.
The compromise model in this case is the "quasi-steady" approximation: provide time-varying mass $m(t)$ as inputs to the `dynamics` method, but leave $\dot{m} = 0$.
If the mass/inertia rate-of-change terms are significant, they can be included as "pseudo-forces" - see [below](#pseudo-forces) for details.
:::

While [`RigidBody`](#archimedes.spatial.RigidBody) uses quaternion kinematics by default for stability and robustness - critical for vehicles like satellites, quadrotors, and fighter jets - there is also the option to use roll-pitch-yaw Euler kinematics for bodies like cars and ships that (nominally) won't reach 90-degrees pitch-up and hit the gimbal lock singularity.
In these cases you can set `rpy_attitude = True` and use a roll-pitch-yaw sequence instead of the `Rotation` for the attitude representation.

Here's the `RigidBody` class in action:

```{code-cell} python

x = RigidBody.State(
    pos=np.array([0.0, 0.0, 10.0]),
    att=Quaternion.identity(),
    v_B=np.zeros(3),
    w_B=np.zeros(3),
)

u = RigidBody.Input(
    F_B=np.array([0.0, 0.0, 9.8]),
    M_B=np.array([0.0, 0.1, 0.0]),
    m=10.0,
    J_B=np.eye(3),
)

RigidBody.dynamics(0.0, x, u)
```

In this simple case, since the body and world axes are aligned (`Rotation.identity()`) and we start out with zero angular velocity, most of the complexity from non-inertial frames in the equations of motion disappears. and we just get $m \dot{\mathbf{v}}^B = \mathbf{F}^B$ and $\mathbf{J}_B \dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^B = \mathbf{M}^B$.

(pseudo-forces)=
### Customizing with pseudo-forces and moments

The equations of motion implemented here are technically correct only for the case of a rigid body with constant mass, inertia, and center of gravity moving in an inertial reference frame and without "internal" angular velocity (gyroscopic effects).
However, the model can be extended to account for these effects if needed by passing pseudo-forces and moments.

In all the following cases, the effects can be treated as constant, quasi-steady (time-varying but with negligible rates), or fully dynamic (time-varying with non-negligible rates).
In both cases, the current value and time derivatve should be tracked and computed outside of the rigid body model, and the appropriate values passed in the input struct.

- **Variable mass**: Quasi-steady mass may be handled by passing the current mass in the input struct.
    The mass rate of change $\dot{m}$ enters the equations of motion via the time derivative of linear momentum:

    ```{math}
    \frac{d}{dt}(m \mathbf{v}^B) = \mathbf{F}^B
    \implies m \dot{\mathbf{v}}^B + \dot{m} \mathbf{v}^B = \mathbf{F}^B
    ```

    Hence, mass flow rates can be accounted for by including the pseudo-force
    $-\dot{m} \mathbf{v}^B$ in the net forces passed as input.

- **Variable inertia**: In the same way, quasi-steady inertia may be handled
    by passing the current inertia matrix in the input struct.  The inertia rate
    of change $\dot{\mathbf{J}}^B$ enters the equations of motion via the
    time derivative of angular momentum:

    ```{math}
    \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{J}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B) = \mathbf{M}^B
    \implies \mathbf{J}^B \dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^B
    + \dot{\mathbf{J}}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B = \mathbf{M}^B
    ```

    Non-negligible inertia rates can be accounted for by including the
    pseudo-moment $-\dot{\mathbf{J}}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B$ in the
    net moment passed as input.

- **Variable center of mass**: The equations of motion are derived about the
    center of mass (CM).  However, typically the body-fixed reference frame B is
    defined at some convenient reference point that may not coincide with the
    instantaneous center of mass.  Properties like aerodynamics and propulsion
    behaviors are also often defined with respect to the reference CM.

    If the reference CM is at the origin of the body frame B and the actual CM
    is at a point $\mathbf{r}_{CM}^B$ in body frame B moving with velocity
    $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{CM}^B$ with respect to the reference point, then
    the relationship between the state velocity $\mathbf{v}^B$ (that is, the
    inertial velocity of the CM expressed in body frame B) and the velocity of
    the reference point $\mathbf{v}_{ref}^B$ is

    ```{math}
    \mathbf{v}^B = \mathbf{v}_{ref}^B +
    \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{CM}^B + \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times
    \mathbf{r}_{CM}^B
    ```

    Often this correction is negligible, but if needed then the state velocity
    should be converted to the reference point velocity before computing
    aerodynamics or other quantities referenced to the body frame origin.
    In the common case that the CM is moving due to fuel consumption or payload
    release, the relative velocity $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{CM}^B$ is usually
    negligible.

    A more important effect is the moment transfer from the offset of the forces
    acting at the reference point to the actual CM.  If the net force acting on
    the vehicle at the reference point is $\mathbf{F}_{ref}^B$, then the
    moment about the CM is given by

    ```{math}
        \mathbf{M}^B = \mathbf{M}_{ref}^B -
        \mathbf{r}_{CM}^B \times \mathbf{F}_{ref}^B
    ```

    The same transformation applies to forces computed about an arbitrary reference
    point, but the moment arm will then be the vector from that reference point to
    the instantaneous CM.

- **Gyroscopic effects**: The full Euler equation for rotational dynamics in a
    non-inertial body-fixed frame is

    ```{math}
        \mathbf{M}^B = \frac{d\mathbf{h}^B}{dt} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^B
        \times \mathbf{h}^B,
    ```

    where $\mathbf{h}^B$ is the net angular momentum of the vehicle in the
    body frame B.  If the vehicle does not have any "internal" angular momentum,
    then $\mathbf{h}^B = \mathbf{J}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B$ and the
    equations reduce to those implemented here.
    
    However, if there are significant additional contributions to angular momentum,
    these affect the dynamics via gyroscopic pseudo-moments.  If a system has
    internal angular momentum $\mathbf{h}_{int}^B =
    \sum_{i} \mathbf{J}_{int,i}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}_{int,i}^B$, these
    contributions must be included:

    ```{math}
        \mathbf{M}^B = \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{J}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B)
        + \frac{d\mathbf{h}_{int}^B}{dt}
        + \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times \mathbf{J}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B
        + \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times \mathbf{h}_{int}^B
    ```

    The additional terms involving $\mathbf{h}_{int}^B$ can be treated as
    pseudo-moments and included in the net moment passed as input.  The usual
    logical flow would be to compute both the internal angular momentum and its
    time derivative outside of the rigid body model (e.g. as a subsystem
    calculation), and then pass the net effective moment

    ```{math}
        \mathbf{M}_\mathrm{eff}^B = \mathbf{M}^B
        - \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{h}_{int}^B)
        - \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times \mathbf{h}_{int}^B
    ```

    as the input to the rigid body dynamics.

    For example, a calculation of the gyroscopic effects of a spinning rotor
    with inertia $\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{rot}^B$, angular velocity
    $\boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathrm{rot}^B$, and negligible angular
    acceleration might look like:

    ```python
    h_int_B = J_rot_B @ w_rot_B  # Rotor angular momentum

    # Compute effective moment including gyroscopic effects
    M_eff_B = M_B - np.cross(w_B, h_int_B)
    ```

    Time-varying subsystem inertias $\mathbf{J}_{int,i}^B$ can also be handled in this way and show up as a pseudo-torque in the effective net moment.

### Non-inertial frames

These equations of motion are valid only
when referenced to a Newtonian inertial frame N.  This is of course an idealization in all cases, but it is always possible to find _some_ frame that is nearly enough inertial for modeling purposes.

A common situation in aerospace applications is to model a body moving relative to a rotating planetary frame E (e.g. the Earth-centered, Earth-fixed frame ECEF) that is assumed to be in non-accelerating but rotating with some angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{E}$ with respect to the inertial frame N.  In this case an alternative formulation uses a state vector composed of:

- $\mathbf{p}^E$ = position of the center of mass in the frame E
- $\mathbf{q}$ = attitude (orientation) of the vehicle with respect to E
- $\mathbf{v}^E$ = velocity of the center of mass in rotating frame E
- $\boldsymbol{\omega}^B$ = angular velocity in body frame (ω_B) with
    respect to the inertial frame N

The equations of motion in this formulation are:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{p}}^E &= \mathbf{v}^E \\
\dot{\mathbf{q}} &= \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{q} \otimes \left(\boldsymbol{\omega}^B - \boldsymbol{\Omega}_{E}^B \right) \\
\dot{\mathbf{v}}^E &= \frac{1}{m}\mathbf{F}^E - 2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}_{E}^E \times \mathbf{v}^E - \boldsymbol{\Omega}_{E}^E \times (\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{E}^E \times \mathbf{p}^E) \\
\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^B &= \mathbf{J}_B^{-1}(\mathbf{M}^B - \boldsymbol{\omega}^B \times (\mathbf{J}^B \boldsymbol{\omega}^B))
\end{align*}
```

Unfortunately, this cannot be straightforwardly reconciled with the implementation here, even with the addition of the Coriolis and centrifugal pseudo-forces.
This is because of the definition of the attitude and angular velocity with respect to different reference frames (E and N, respectively).
Using the angular velocity relative to frame N allows the use of the Euler dynamics equation without complex pseudo-moments, but means that the angular velocity must be modified by $-\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{E}^B$ in the attitude kinematics.

The equations above could be implemented in an ECEF frame with a simple custom rigid body class:

```python
@struct
class EarthReferencedBody:
    rot_earth: float = 7.292e-5

    @struct
    class State:
        pos: np.ndarray  # ECEF position
        att: Attitude  # Body attitude relative to ECEF
        v_E: np.ndarray  # ECEF velocity
        w_B: np.ndarray

    @struct
    class Input:
        F_E: np.ndarray  # Forces in Earth frame
        M_B: np.ndarray  # Moments in body frame
        m: float  # Mass
        J_B: np.ndarray  # Inertia matrix in body frame

    def dynamics(self, t: float, x: State, u: Input) -> State:
        Ω_E = np.hstack([0.0, 0.0, self.rot_earth])
        R_BE = x.att.as_matrix()
        v_E, p_E = x.v_E, x.pos  # ECEF position, velocity

        # Position and attitude kinematics
        pos_deriv = v_E
        att_deriv = x.att.kinematics(x.w_B - x.w_B - R_BE @ Ω_E)

        # Force equation with Coriolis and centrifugal effects
        dv_E = (u.F_E / u.m) - np.cross(Ω_E, 2 * v_E - np.cross(Ω_E, p_E))
        
        # Moment equation (same as body-referenced formulation)
        dw_B = np.linalg.solve(
            u.J_B, u.M_B - np.cross(x.w_B, u.J_B @ x.w_B)
        )

        # Output time derivatives of substates
        return RigidBody.State(
            pos=pos_deriv, att=att_deriv, v_E=dv_E, w_B=dw_B
        )
```

While this formulation does cover a substantial number of orbtial mechanics applications, it is not one-size-fits all.
Are centrifugal effects accounted for in the gravity model?
Are precession and nutation important?
Is the
angular velocity time-varying?
The present design prioritizes _customization_ over _comprehensiveness_.

In short, handling of non-inertial frames in Archimedes still needs some design work and is not robustly supported.
The recommendation is to implement custom rigid body dynamics based on the above equations.
If you would like to see support for non-inertial frames be a higher priority, please feel free to raise the issue in the [Discussions](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/discussions) page on GitHub.

## Custom Vehicle Models

The power of `RigidBody` comes from being able to use this as a component inside more complex vehicle models.

Two basic patterns you might use for this are **inheritance** and **composition**.

### Inheritance

With this pattern, the vehicle model simply inherits from `RigidBody` directly.
This is convenient when there are no additional state variables in the model, for instance with a flight dynamics model that uses lookup tables for aerodynamics and propulsion models:

```python
@struct
class Aircraft(RigidBody):
    m: float
    J_B: np.ndarray

    @struct
    class Input:
        throttle: float
        rudder: float
        aileron: float
        elevator: float

    def calc_aero(
        self, x: RigidBody.State, u: Aircraft.Input
    ) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
        """Calculate aerodynamic forces and moments"""

    def calc_eng(
        self, x: RigidBody.State, u: Aircraft.Input
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        """Calculate engine thrust"""

    def dynamics(
        self, t: float, x: RigidBody.State, u: Aircraft.Input
    ) -> RigidBody.State:
        # Aerodynamics and propulsion models
        F_aero_B, M_aero_B = self.calc_aero(x, u)
        F_eng_B = self.calc_eng(x, u)

        # Use the state attitude to calculate gravity in body axes
        F_grav_N = self.m * np.hstack([0, 0, 9.81])
        R_BN = x.att.as_matrix()
        F_grav_B = R_BN @ F_grav_N

        # Net forces/moments
        F_B = F_aero_B + F_eng_B + F_grav_B
        M_B = M_aero_B

        # Use RigidBody.dynamics to evaluate the equations of motion
        u_rb = RigidBody.Input(F_B=F_B, M_B=M_B, m=self.m, J_B=self.J_B)
        return super().dynamics(t, x, u_rb)
```

### Composition

For more complex models it is usually more convenient to instead treat the `RigidBody` as one component of several.
This can be a more natural way to organize hierarchical state variables:

```python
@struct
class Aircraft:
    gravity: GravityModel
    atmosphere: AtmosphereModel

    aero: AeroModel
    engine: EngineModel

    m: float
    J_B: np.ndarray

    @struct
    class State(RigidBody.State):
        aero: AeroModel.State
        engine: Engine.State

    @struct
    class Input:
        throttle: float
        rudder: float
        aileron: float
        elevator: float

    def dynamics(
        self, t: float, x: Aircraft.State, u: Aircraft.Input
    ) -> Aircraft.State:
        # Aerodynamics and propulsion models
        F_aero_B, M_aero_B = self.aero.output(x, u)
        F_eng_B = self.engine.output(x, u)

        # Time derivatives of aerodynamic and engine states
        x_aero_dot = self.aero.dynamics(x, u)
        x_eng_dot = self.engine.dynamics(x, u)

        # Use the state attitude to calculate gravity in body axes
        F_grav_N = self.gravity(x.rigid_body.pos)
        R_BN = x.rigid_body.att.as_matrix()
        F_grav_B = R_BN @ F_grav_N

        # Net forces/moments
        F_B = F_aero_B + F_prop_B + F_grav_B
        M_B = M_aero_B

        # Evaluate the equations of motion
        u_rb = RigidBody.Input(F_B=F_B, M_B=M_B, m=self.m, J_B=self.J_B)
        x_rb_dot = RigidBody.dynamics(x, u_rb)

        return self.State(
            pos=x_rb_dot.pos,
            att=x_rb_dot.att,
            v_B=x_rb_dot.v_B,
            w_B=x_rb_dot.w_B,
            aero=x_aero_dot,
            engine=x_eng_dot,
        )
```

Now the aerodynamic state can handle lag effects or other unsteady aerodynamic behavior, and the engine can have its own internal dynamics as well.
This can be a much more flexible and powerful approach - since the `Aircraft` implementation doesn't handle the details of any of these subsystems, it's easy to create and test a range of different component models.
For instance, the engine model here could be anything from a simple linear thrust approximation to a detailed physics-based propulsion system model including turbomachinery and combustion calculations.

(looking-ahead)=
## Looking Ahead

We've covered a lot of ground already, so this isn't the place for a lengthy design doc or roadmap, but it's worth mentioning where this is headed.

Again, the 6dof rigid body state has four components:

- `pos`: the position of the body in the inertial frame ($\mathbf{p}^N$)
- `att`: the attitude of the body with respect to the inertial frame ($\mathbf{q}$)
- `v_B`: the translational velocity of the body in its own coordinate system B ($\mathbf{v}^B$)
- `w_B`: the body-relative angular velocity vector ($\boldsymbol{\omega}^B$)

In state-space dynamics modeling, it's natural to think of this as a 13-element state vector.
However, from a spatial mechanics point of view, this is really a representation of two things:

1. A coordinate system B defined relative to N by a translation $\mathbf{p}^N$ and orientation $\mathbf{q}$.
2. The translational and rotational motion of the body in coordinate system B

Let's take a brief technical digression, which you can feel free to skim if uninterested.

In spatial geometry lingo, the numerical representation of the motion are the "Plücker coordinates", meaning that $\mathbf{v}^B$ and $\boldsymbol{\omega}^B$ together form an element of the 6D space of spatial motions $M^6$.
Likewise, the input combination of body-frame forces and moments are also expressed in Plücker coordinates, so $\mathbf{F}^B$ and $\mathbf{M}^B$ together form an element of the 6D space of spatial forces $F^6$, dual to $M^6$.

Getting back to practical terms, what this means is that we can layer on top of the `Attitude` and `RigidBody` concepts two new abstractions: a `Transformation` (translation + attitude) and a 6D `SpatialVector` (element of $M^6$ or $F^6$).

### Transformations

A `Transformation` is basically a combination of a position and an orientation, sometimes called a _homogeneous transformation_.
This could be applied to points (both translation and rotation) or pure vectors (rotation only).

A sketch of the implementation would look something like the following:

```python
@struct
class Transformation
    t: np.ndarray  # Translation (3,)
    r: Attitude

    def apply(self, pos: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        return self.t + self.apply_vec(pos)

    def apply_vec(self, vec: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        R = self.r.as_matrix()
        return R @ vec

    def inv(self) -> Transformation:
        ...
```

The `Transformation` concept will also let us create _kinematic trees_ - a way to express relationships between various reference frames and coordinate systems.
The API design for both the `Transformation` and `KinematicTree` are still fairly hazy, but the goal is to eliminate much of the bookkeeping associated with the exploding numbers of coordinate systems common in orbital mechanics and robotics applications, for instance.
Ideally, you would simply define the relationships between the frames (including how they evolve with time) and be able to simply call:

```python
X_BE = ktree.get_transform("earth", "body")
r_B = X_BE.apply(r_E)  # ECEF -> NED tangent plane -> body frame
```

### Multibody dynamics

While `Transformation` and kinematic trees would be convenient for keeping track of complicated arrangements of coordinate systems, the 6D spatial vectors open up more exciting possibilities.
This is because this abstraction maps directly to [Roy Featherstone-style spatial vector algebra](https://bleyer.org/files/A%20Beginner%27s%20Guide%20to%206-D%20Vectors%20-%20Feathersone%20(IEEE,%202010).pdf), including generalized spatial velocity, force, inertia, and associated constraints between multibody motion.

If we can set up a way to intuitively work with these vectors, we can get clean, performant implementations of powerful algorithms like Recursive Newton-Euler, Compositite Rigid Body, and the Articulated Body Algorithm.
These are the cornerstones of constrained multibody dynamics - that is, robotics.

Once we have transformations, kinematic trees, spatial vectors, and rigid body algorithms, we can then layer on 3D contact and collision models to get a true robotics simulator along the lines of MuJoCo or Drake.

Now, there are existing options for all kinds of robotics work out there already (MuJoCo and Drake being my personal favorites), so you may well ask: why build another robotics simulator?
The basic premise is that robotics will continue to converge with other engineering disciplines, so even outside of "traditional" robotics we'll see more articulation, more underactuation, and more autonomy.
Putting capabilities for robotics-type work under the same roof as flight dynamics, orbital mechanics, battery modeling, lumped-parameter multiphysics models, etc. with deployment capabilities could make it easier to build almost anything you can think of.

Multibody dynamics and contact won't be coming for a while, and the plans could certainly change between now and then, but it's worth mentioning now because (as you can see from the choice to use body-frame velocity) these plans will inform the design and priorities of the spatial mechanics functionality well before we can simulate anything that looks like a robot.

## Parting Thoughts

The new `spatial` module is the first core physics modeling functionality in Archimedes, but this is just the beginning.
For `spatial` itself, the next priorities are _spatial transformations_ (transformation + rotation), _kinematic trees_ for handling multiple reference frames, and _interpolations_ (slerp) for trajectory generation and optimization.

Beyond `spatial`, we'll be adding some common functionality for different classes of vehicle models, such as reference gravitational and atmospheric models like WGS84 and USSA1976.
Tools for detailed propulsion systems modeling are more niche and thus farther out on the roadmap, but there are proof of concept demos already, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in that.

Finally, to see this module in action check out the [Subsonic F-16 series](../../tutorials/f16/f16_00.md), where we implement the NASA F-16 benchmark from scratch, relying heavily on `spatial` for attitude representations and 6dof dynamics.
More detailed application examples will be released soon to provide full reference implementations of different classes of vehicle dynamics models (particularly aerospace-related, but also reach out if there's something else you'd like to see).
