    """
    Apply a function repeatedly while carrying state between iterations.

    Efficiently implements a loop that accumulates state and collects outputs at each
    iteration. Similar to functional fold/reduce operations but also accumulates the
    intermediate outputs. This provides a structured way to express iterative
    algorithms in a functional style that can be efficiently compiled and
    differentiated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        A function with signature ``func(carry, x) -> (new_carry, y)`` to be applied at
        each loop iteration. The function must:

        - Accept exactly two arguments: the current carry value and loop variable

        - Return exactly two values: the updated carry value and an output for this step

        - Return a carry with the same structure as the input carry

    init_carry : array_like or Tree
        The initial value of the carry state. Can be a scalar, array, or structured
        data type. The structure of this value defines what ``func`` must return as
        its first output.
    xs : array_like, optional
        The values to loop over, with shape ``(length, ...)``. Each value is passed as
        the second argument to ``func``. Required unless length is provided.
    length : int, optional
        The number of iterations to run. Required if ``xs`` is None. If both are
        provided, ``xs.shape[0]`` must equal ``length``.

    Returns
    -------
    final_carry : same type as ``init_carry``
        The final carry value after all iterations.
    ys : array
        The stacked outputs from each iteration, with shape ``(length, ...)``.

    Notes
    -----
    When to use this function:

    - To keep computational graph size manageable for large loops
    - For implementing recurrent computations (filters, RNNs, etc.)
    - For iterative numerical methods (e.g., fixed-point iterations)

    Conceptual model:
    Each iteration applies ``func`` to the current carry value and the current loop
    value: ``(carry, y) = func(carry, x)``

    The ``carry`` is threaded through all iterations, while each ``y`` output is
    collected. This pattern is common in many iterative algorithms and can be more
    efficient than explicit Python loops because it creates a single node in the
    computational graph regardless of the number of iterations.

    The standard Python equivalent would be:

    .. highlight:: python
    .. code-block:: python

        def scan_equivalent(func, init_carry, xs=None, length=None):
            if xs is None:
                xs = range(length)
            carry = init_carry
            ys = []
            for x in xs:
                carry, y = func(carry, x)
                ys.append(y)
            return carry, np.stack(ys)


    However, the compiled ``scan`` is more efficient for long loops because it creates a
    fixed-size computational graph regardless of loop length.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic summation:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import archimedes as arc
    >>>
    >>> @arc.compile
    ... def sum_func(carry, x):
    ...     new_carry = carry + x
    ...     return new_carry, new_carry
    >>>
    >>> xs = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> final_sum, intermediates = arc.scan(sum_func, 0, xs)
    >>> print(final_sum)  # 15
    >>> print(intermediates)  # [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]

    Implementing a discrete-time IIR filter:

    >>> @arc.compile
    ... def iir_step(state, x):
    ...     # Simple first-order IIR filter: y[n] = 0.9*y[n-1] + 0.1*x[n]
    ...     new_state = 0.9 * state + 0.1 * x
    ...     return new_state, new_state
    >>>
    >>> # Apply to a step input
    >>> input_signal = np.ones(50)
    >>> initial_state = 0.0
    >>> final_state, filtered = arc.scan(iir_step, initial_state, input_signal)

    Implementing Euler's method for ODE integration:

    >>> @arc.compile
    ... def euler_step(state, t):
    ...     # Simple harmonic oscillator: d²x/dt² = -x
    ...     dt = 0.001
    ...     x, v = state
    ...     new_x = x + dt * v
    ...     new_v = v - dt * x
    ...     return (new_x, new_v), new_x
    >>>
    >>> ts = np.linspace(0, 1.0, 1001)
    >>> initial_state = (1.0, 0.0)  # x=1, v=0
    >>> final_state, trajectory = arc.scan(euler_step, initial_state, ts)

    Selectively apply one of several functions based on an index.

    This function provides a conditional branching mechanism that selects and applies
    one of the provided branch functions based on the index value. The function is
    similar to a switch/case statement but can be embedded within computational graphs.

    Semantically, this function is equivalent to the following Python code:

    .. highlight:: python
    .. code-block:: python

        def switch(index, branches, *args):
            index = min(max(index, 0), len(branches) - 1)
            return branches[index](*args)

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : int
        The branch selector. Must be an integer. If the index is out of bounds,
        it will be clamped to the valid range ``[0, len(branches)-1]``.
    branches : tuple of callables
        A tuple of functions to choose from. Each function must accept the same
        arguments and return compatible structures.
    *args : Tree
        Arguments to pass to the selected branch function. All branches must
        accept these arguments.
    name : str, optional
        Name for the resulting function. Used for debugging and visualization.
        Default is "switch_{index}".
    kind : str, optional
        The kind of symbolics to use when constructing the function. Default is "MX".

    Returns
    -------
    Tree
        The result of applying the selected branch function to the provided arguments.
        All branches must return the same structure.

    Notes
    -----
    This function converts conditional branching into a computational graph construct.
    Unlike Python's if/else, which doesn't work with symbolic values, ``switch`` is
    compatible with symbolic/numeric execution.

    The function evaluates each branch at compilation time to ensure they have
    compatible output structures. At runtime, only the selected branch is executed.

    Behavior notes:

    - If `index` is out of bounds, it will be clamped to the valid range.
    - All branches must return the same tree structure, or a ValueError will be
      raised.
    - At least two branches must be provided, or a ValueError will be raised.
    - Functions are traced at compilation time, meaning any side effects will occur
      for all branches during tracing, even though only one branch executes at runtime.
      It is strongly recommended to avoid side effects.
    - This function supports automatic differentiation

    >>> apply_operation(x, 0)  # Returns x**2
    >>> apply_operation(x, 1)  # Returns sin(x)

    Vectorize a function along specified argument axes.

    The `vmap` transformation takes a function that operates on individual elements
    and transforms it into one that operates on batches of elements in a vectorized
    manner. This enables efficient computation without writing explicit loops or
    broadcasting logic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Function to be vectorized. The function can accept ordinary NumPy arrays
        or tree-structured data.
    in_axes : int, None, or tuple of ints/None, optional
        Specifies which axis of each input argument should be mapped over.

        - int: Use the same axis for all arguments (e.g., 0 for the first dimension)

        - None: Don't map this argument (broadcast it to all mapped elements)

        - tuple: Specify a different axis for each argument

        Default is 0 (map over the first axis of each argument).
    out_axes : int, optional
        Specifies where the mapped axis should appear in the output.
        Default is 0 (mapped axis is the first dimension of the output).
    name : str, optional
        Name for the transformed function. If None, derives a name from the
        original function.

    Returns
    -------
    vectorized_func : callable
        A function with the same signature as `func` that operates on batches of inputs.

    Notes
    -----
    When to use this function:

    - When you need to apply the same operation to many inputs efficiently
    - To convert a single-example function into one that handles batches
    - To selectively vectorize over some arguments while broadcasting others
    - To "unflatten" tree-structured data by mapping the unravel function

    Conceptual model:

    `vmap` transforms functions to operate along array axes. For example, a function
    f(x) that takes a vector and returns a scalar can be transformed into one that
    takes a batch of vectors (an array) and returns a batch of scalars (a vector),
    without explicitly writing loops.

    Each argument can be mapped differently:
    - Mapped arguments (in_axes is an int): Batched processing along the specified axis
    - Broadcasted arguments (in_axes is None): Same value used for all batch elements

    The vectorized function ensures that all mapped arguments have the same size
    along their mapped dimensions.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic vectorization of a dot product:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import archimedes as arc
    >>>
    >>> def dot(a, b):
    ...     return np.dot(a, b)
    >>>
    >>> # Vectorize to compute multiple dot products at once
    >>> batched_dot = arc.vmap(dot)
    >>>
    >>> # Input: batch of vectors (3 vectors of length 2)
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> y = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]])
    >>>
    >>> # Output: batch of scalars (3 dot products)
    >>> batched_dot(x, y)
    array([ 23,  67, 127])

    Working with tree-structured data:

    >>> from archimedes import struct
    >>>
    >>> @struct
    >>> class Particle:
    ...     x: np.ndarray
    ...     v: np.ndarray
    >>>
    >>> def update(p, dt):
    ...     return p.replace(x=p.x + dt * p.v)
    >>>
    >>> # Vectorize to update multiple particles at once
    >>> map_update = arc.vmap(update, in_axes=(0, None))

    >>> x = np.random.randn(10, 3)  # 10 particles in 3D space
