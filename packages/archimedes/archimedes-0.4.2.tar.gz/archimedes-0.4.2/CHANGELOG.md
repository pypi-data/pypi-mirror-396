# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with pre-1.0 development conventions.
In particular, the API is still evolving and may change between minor versions, although we'll aim to document such changes here.
