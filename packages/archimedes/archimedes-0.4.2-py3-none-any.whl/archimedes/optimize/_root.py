    Construct an explicit function from an implicit relation.

    Given a relation ``F(x, p) = 0`` that implicitly defines ``x`` as a function of
    ``p``, this function creates a solver that computes ``x`` given ``p`` and an
    initial guess. This effectively transforms the equation ``F(x, p) = 0`` into an
    explicit function ``x = G(x0, p)`` that returns the solution ``x`` for parameters
    ``p`` starting from initial guess ``x0``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The implicit function, with signature ``func(x, *args)``. Must return a
        residual with the same shape and dtype as the input ``x``.
    static_argnames : tuple of str, optional
        Names of arguments that should be treated as static (non-symbolic)
        parameters. Static arguments are not differentiated through and
        the solver will be recompiled when their values change.
    solver : str, default="newton"
        The root-finding method to use. Options are:

        - ``"newton"`` : Newton's method (default), best for general problems

        - ``"fast_newton"`` : Simple Newton iterations with no line search

        - ``"kinsol"`` : KINSOL solver from SUNDIALS, robust for large systems

    name : str, optional
        Name for the returned function. If ``None``, a name will be generated
        based on the input function name.
    tol : float, optional
        Absolute for convergence. If ``None``, the default tolerance for the
        chosen method will be used.
    **options : dict, optional
        Common additional options specific to the chosen method:

        For ``"newton"`` and ``"fast_newton"``:

        - max_iter : int, maximum iterations (default: 100)

        For ``"kinsol"``:

        - max_iter : int, maximum iterations
    
        - strategy : str, globalization strategy (``"none"``, ``"linesearch"``,\
        ``"picard"``, ``"fp"``)

        See the `CasADi documentation <https://web.casadi.org/python-api/#rootfinding/>`_
        for more details on the available options for each method.

    Returns
    -------
    solver : FunctionCache
        A function that, when called with signature ``solver(x0, *args)``,
        returns the solution ``x`` to ``F(x, *args) = 0`` starting from the initial
        guess ``x0``. This function can be evaluated both numerically and symbolically.

    Notes
    -----
    When to use this function:

    - When you have an equation ``F(x, p) = 0`` that you need to solve repeatedly
      for different values of parameters ``p``
    - For implementing equations of motion for constrained mechanical systems
    - For implicit numerical schemes in simulation
    - For embedding root-finding operations within larger computational graphs

    The solver automatically computes the Jacobian of the residual function
    using automatic differentiation.

    For simple one-off root-finding problems where parameters don't change,
    consider using :py:func:`root` instead which provides a simpler interface.

    The function generates a callable that behaves as a pure function, making
    it suitable for embedding in larger computational graphs or differentiating
    through.

    >>> solution = solver(x0, 2.0, 3.0)
    >>> print(solution)  # Should converge to a valid solution
    >>>
    >>> # Example 3: Using a different solver and options
    >>> def kepler(x, e):
    ...     # Kepler's equation: x - e*sin(x) = M where M is fixed at 0.5
    ...     return x - e * np.sin(x) - 0.5
    >>>
    >>> # Create solver with more iterations and higher accuracy

    ... )

    ----------
    func : callable
        The function whose root to find, with signature ``func(x, *args)``.

    -----
    This function leverages Archimedes' automatic differentiation to compute
    the Jacobian matrix required by most root-finding methods. For repeated
    solving with different parameters, use :py:func:`implicit` directly to create
    a reusable solver function.
