@struct
class EulerAngles:
    """Euler angle representation of a rotation in 3 dimensions

    Parameters
    ----------
    angles : array_like
        Euler angles in radians
    seq : str, optional
        Sequence of axes for Euler angles (up to length 3).  Each character must be one
        of 'x', 'y', 'z' (extrinsic) or 'X', 'Y', 'Z' (intrinsic).  Default is 'xyz'.

    Attributes
    ----------
    array : np.ndarray
        Underlying array of Euler angles.
    seq : str
        Sequence of axes for Euler angles.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from archimedes.spatial import EulerAngles
    >>> import numpy as np

    Consider a right-handed rotation of 90 degrees about the z-axis. This
    corresponds to a single yaw rotation:

    >>> euler = EulerAngles(np.deg2rad(90), 'z')

    This can be converted to other representations:

    >>> euler.as_matrix()
    array([[ 6.123234e-17,  1.000000e+00,  0.000000e+00],
       [-1.000000e+00,  6.123234e-17,  0.000000e+00],
       [ 0.000000e+00,  0.000000e+00,  1.000000e+00]])
    >>> np.rad2deg(euler.as_euler('xyx'))  # Roll-pitch-roll sequence
    array([-90.,  90.,  90.])
    >>> euler.as_quat()
    Quaternion([0.70710678 0.         0.         0.70710678])

    The associated rotation matrix can be used to change coordinate systems. If the
    Euler sequence represents the orientation of a frame B relative to a frame A, then
    the rotation matrix transforms vectors from frame A to frame B:

    >>> v_A = np.array([1, 0, 0])  # Vector in frame A
    >>> R_BA = euler.as_matrix()
    >>> R_BA @ v_A  # Vector in frame B
    [6.12323e-17, -1, 0]

    The ``kinematics`` method can be used to compute the time derivative of the
    Euler angles given the angular velocity in the body frame. Note that Euler
    kinematics are currently only supported for the "xyz" sequence (standard
    roll-pitch-yaw):

    >>> w_B = np.array([0, 0, np.pi/2])  # 90 deg/s about z-axis
    >>> rpy = EulerAngles([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "xyz")
    >>> rpy.kinematics(w_B)
    EulerAngles([ 0.31682542 -0.15681796  1.59473746], seq='xyz')

    Be careful with the kinematics output; this is expressed as an ``EulerAngles``
    instance for consistency with ODE solvers but represents rotation _rates_.
    Trying to apply this output as a rotation or convert to a DCM will not produce
    meaningful results.

@struct
class Quaternion:
    """Quaternion representation of a rotation in 3 dimensions.

    This class is closely modeled after [scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation](
    https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html)
    with a few differences:

    - The quaternion is always represented in scalar-first format
      (i.e. [w, x, y, z]) instead of scalar-last ([x, y, z, w]).
    - This class is designed for symbolic computation, so some checks (e.g. for valid
      rotation matrices) are omitted, since these cannot be done symbolically.
    - The class does not support multiple rotations in a single object
    - This implementation supports kinematic calculations

    The following operations on quaternions are supported:

    - Application on vectors (rotations of vectors)
    - Quaternion Composition
    - Quaternion Inversion
    - Kinematic time derivative given angular velocity

    Parameters
    ----------
    quat : array_like, shape (4,)
        Quaternion representing the rotation in scalar-first format (w, x, y, z).

    Attributes
    ----------
    array : np.ndarray, shape (4,)
        Underlying numpy array representing the quaternion.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from archimedes.spatial import Quaternion
    >>> import numpy as np

    Consider a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees about the z-axis. This
    corresponds to the following quaternion (in scalar-first format):

    >>> q = Quaternion([np.cos(np.pi/4), 0, 0, np.sin(np.pi/4)])

    The quaternion can be expressed in any of the other formats:

    >>> q.as_matrix()
    array([[ 2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00],
       [-1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16,  0.00000000e+00],
       [ 0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  1.00000000e+00]])
    >>> np.rad2deg(q.as_euler('zyx'))
    array([90.,  0.,  0.])

    The same quaternion can be initialized using a rotation matrix:

    >>> q = Quaternion.from_matrix([[0, 1, 0],
    ...                    [-1, 0, 0],
    ...                    [0, 0, 1]])

    Representation in other formats:

    >>> np.rad2deg(q.as_euler('zyx'))
    array([90.,  0.,  0.])

    The ``from_euler`` method is flexible in the range of input formats
    it supports. Here we initialize a quaternion about a single axis:

    >>> q = Quaternion.from_euler(np.deg2rad(90), 'z')

    The associated rotation matrix can be used to change coordinate systems. If the
    quaternion represents the orientation of a frame B relative to a frame A, then the
    rotation matrix transforms vectors from frame A to frame B:

    >>> v_A = np.array([1, 0, 0])  # Vector in frame A
    >>> R_BA = q.as_matrix()
    >>> R_BA @ v_A  # Vector in frame B
    [6.12323e-17, -1, 0]

    The ``kinematics`` method can be used to compute the time derivative of the
    quaternion as an attitude representation given the angular velocity in the
    body frame using quaternion kinematics:

    >>> w_B = np.array([0, 0, np.pi/2])  # 90 deg/s about z-axis
    >>> q.kinematics(w_B)
    array([-0.55536037,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.55536037])
