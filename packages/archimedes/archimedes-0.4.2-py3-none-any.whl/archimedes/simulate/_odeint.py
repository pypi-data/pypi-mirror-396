"""Interface for solving ordinary differential equations.

This module has two main functions: `integrator` and `odeint`.  The `integrator`
function is a transformation that creates a "forward map" for the given function.
This forward map is a new function that integrates the ODE defined by the original
function.  The `odeint` function is a simple wrapper around the `integrator` function
that calls the generated forward map with the given initial state and time span.
`odeint` has a similar interface to `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`.

    """Create an ODE solver function from a dynamics function.

    Transforms a function defining an ODE into a function that propagates the ODE
    system forward in time. The resulting function can be used repeatedly with
    different initial conditions and parameters, and supports automatic differentiation
    through the solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function defining the ODE dynamics. Must have the signature
        ``func(t, x, *args) -> x_t``, where ``t`` is the current time,
        ``x`` is the current state, and ``x_t`` is the derivative of
        the state with respect to time.
    method : str, optional
        Integration method to use. Default is ``"cvodes"``, which uses the
        SUNDIALS CVODES solver (suitable for both stiff and non-stiff systems).
        See CasADi documentation for other available methods.
    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for the solver. Default is ``1e-6``.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for the solver. Default is ``1e-3``.
    static_argnames : tuple of str, optional
        Names of arguments to ``func`` that should be treated as static
        (not traced symbolically).
    t_eval : array_like, optional
        Times at which to evaluate the solution. If provided, the integrator
        will return states at these times. If None, the integrator will
        only return the final state.
    name : str, optional
        Name for the created integrator function. If None, a name is
        automatically generated based on the dynamics function's name.
    **options : dict
        Additional options to pass to the CasADi integrator.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        If ``t_eval`` is None, a function with signature
        ``solver(x0, t_span, *args) -> xf``, where ``x0`` is the initial state,
        ``t_span`` is a tuple ``(t0, tf)`` giving the integration time span, and ``xf``
        is the final state.

        If ``t_eval`` is provided, a function with signature
        ``solver(x0, *args) -> xs``, where ``xs`` is an array of states at the times in
        ``t_eval``.

    Notes
    -----
    When to use this function:

    - For repeated ODE solves with different initial conditions or parameters
    - When embedding ODE solutions in optimization problems or larger models
    - When sensitivity analysis requires derivatives of the solution
    - For improved performance over loop-based ODE integration

    The ODE solver is specified by the ``method`` argument. The default is ``"cvodes"``,
    which uses the SUNDIALS CVODES solver and is suitable for both stiff and non-stiff
    systems. This is the recommended choice for most applications.

    See the [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/python-api/#integrator) documentation for a
    complete list of available configuration options to pass to the `options` argument.

    Conceptual model:
    This function constructs a computational graph representation of the entire
    ODE solve operation. The resulting function is more efficient than repeatedly
    calling :py:func:``odeint`` because:

    - It pre-compiles the solver for a specific state dimension and parameter structure
    - It leverages CasADi's compiled C++ implementation for high-performance integration
    - It enables automatic differentiation through the entire solution

    Limitations:

    - Only scalar and vector states are supported (shapes like ``(n,)`` or ``(n,1)``)
    - If ``t_eval`` is provided, the function caches the evaluation times internally,
      meaning new evaluation times require recompiling the function

    ----------

        Right-hand side of the ODE system. The calling signature is

        Initial state.
    method : str, optional
        Integration method to use. Default is ``"cvodes"``, which uses the
        SUNDIALS CVODES solver (suitable for both stiff and non-stiff systems).
    t_eval : array_like or None, optional

    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for the solver. Default is ``1e-6``.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for the solver. Default is ``1e-3``.
    args : tuple, optional
        Additional arguments to pass to the ODE function.
    static_argnames : tuple of str, optional
        Names of arguments to `func` that should be treated as static
        (not traced symbolically).
    **options : dict
        Additional options to pass to the CasADi integrator.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        If ``t_eval`` is None, the state at the final time ``t_span[1]``.
        If ``t_eval`` is provided, an array containing the solution evaluated at
        ``t_eval`` with shape ``(n, len(t_eval))``.

    Notes
    -----

    The underlying SUNDIALS solvers use adaptive step size control to balance
    accuracy and computational efficiency.  However, unlike SciPy's ``solve_ivp``
    function and many other ODE solver interfaces, it is not possible to output
    the solution at the times actually used by the solver (or to create a "dense"
    output using an interpolant). This is because of the requirement that all input
    and output arrays be a fixed size in order to construct the symbolic graph. The
    solution at output times specified by ``t_eval`` is computed by interpolating the
    solution at the times used by the solver.

    The ODE solver is specified by the ``method`` argument. The default is ``"cvodes"``,
    which uses the SUNDIALS CVODES solver and is suitable for both stiff and non-stiff
    systems. This is the recommended choice for most applications.

    See the `CasADi <https://web.casadi.org/python-api/#integrator/>`_ documentation
    for a complete list of available configuration options to pass to the ``options``
    argument.

    Conceptual model:
    This function is a wrapper around the :py:func:``integrator`` function that creates
    and immediately calls an ODE solver for the given initial conditions and
    parameters. It provides a simple interface similar to SciPy's ``solve_ivp``
    but leverages CasADi's efficient symbolic implementation and interface to
    SUNDIALS solvers.

    Unlike :py:func:`integrator`, which creates a reusable solver function,
    ``odeint`` performs a single solve operation. If you need to solve the same ODE
    system repeatedly with different initial conditions or parameters, it's more
    efficient to create an ``integrator`` function once and reuse it.

    Limitations:

    - Only scalar and vector states are supported (shapes like ``(n,)`` or ``(n,1)``)
    - For tree-structured states, currently the user must define a wrapper function
      to flatten and reconstruct the tree structure
