        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
        1. Definitions.
        
           "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
           and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
           "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
           the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
           "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
           "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction
           or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
           ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
           beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
           "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
           permissions granted by this License.

           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
           the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

           excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
           "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
           on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
           subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
        2. Grant of Copyright License.  
           Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
           hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
           royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
           Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
           distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License.  
           Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
           hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
           royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
           to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
           the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
           licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
           Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
           litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
           lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
           Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
           patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
           terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution.  
           You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
           thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
           Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        
           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
               a copy of this License; and
        
           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
               that You changed the files; and
        
           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
               distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
               from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
        
           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
               such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
               part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
               within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works,
               within the Source form, or within a display generated by the
               Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
               appear; and
        
           (e) You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
               that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
               file, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
               construed as modifying the License.
        
           You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for
           use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any
           such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
           distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
           in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions.  
           Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
           submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
           the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms
           or conditions.
           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
           terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
           Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks.  
           This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
           trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
           required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
           Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
           Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
           provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on
           an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
           express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
           conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
           associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability.  
           In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
           negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
           (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
           shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
           indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
           arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use

           However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
           and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
           and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
           harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
           Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
           liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Project Description

RareLink is a novel rare disease framework based on REDCap that connects 
international registries, FHIR, and Phenopackets. It provides comprehensive 
documentation and user guides to enable sustainable data management for your 
local rare disease REDCap project.

Built on the [RD-CDM](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html), 
all RareLink-CDM pipelines are preconfigured to generate FHIR resources compliant
with the [HL7 International Patient Summary](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/) 
, [HL7 Genomics Reporting profiles](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/) 
or validated GA4GH Phenopackets. For disease-specific extensions, detailed guides  
are available to help you develop sheets that integrate seamlessly with the 
RareLink framework.

If you are familiar with REDCap but lack coding experience, you can still set up 
your local RareLink REDCap project and begin capturing data. However, some coding 
experience is recommended for accessing advanced functionalities.

## Features

REDCap is a widely-used clinical electronic data capture system, licensed by 
institutions worldwide. RareLink enhances REDCap by providing detailed 
guidelines for structuring and encoding data to ensure seamless integration 
with its preconfigured FHIR and Phenopacket pipelines. Built on the 
[Rare Disease Common Data Model v2.0 (RD-CDM)](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html)
RareLink is ready-to-use and extensible for disease-specific requirements.

![RareLink Overview](docs/_static/res/rarelink_overview.png)

RareLink integrates the following features for rare disease data management in 
REDCap: 

1. **RareLink CLI**: Set up and manage your project via the 
   [Command Line Interface](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_rarelink_framework/2_4_rarelink_cli.html), 
   including API setup, instrument configuration, and running FHIR or Phenopacket 
   pipelines.
2. **Native REDCap Usage**: Downloadable REDCap forms for all [RD-CDM sections](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html), 
   complete with installation guides and manuals for manual data capture and 
   BioPortal connection.
3. **Semi-Automated Data Capture**: Use a template script to map your tabular
   data to the RareLink-CDM, which is in [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/).
   This process includes syntactic mapping, local semantic encoding, validation,
   and data upload to REDCap for FHIR or Phenopacket export.
4. **RareLink-Phenopacket Engine**: Predefined configurations enable seamless 
   export of the RD-CDM data and extensions to validated Phenopackets -> [User Guide](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_3_phenopackets.html).
5. **HL7 FHIR Export**: RareLink uses the open-source 
   [_toFHIR_ Engine](https://github.com/srdc/tofhir) to export data to any FHIR 
   server, supporting profiles based on the 
   [HL7 International Patient Summary v2.0.0](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/),
   the [HL7 GenomicsReporting v3.0.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/STU3/index.html)
   and FHIR Base Resources (v4.0.1).
   - [RareLink FHIR Implementation Guide in draft](https://bih-cei.github.io/rarelink/) 
6. **Customising RareLink & RD-CDM Extensions**: [Guidelines for modeling and encoding custom data](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_5_develop_redcap_instruments.html)
   extensions ensure compatibility with the RareLink framework and its pipelines.

## Getting Started

Begin by exploring the RareLink [Background section](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_0_background_file.html) 
to understand the framework's scope and components.

To start using RareLink, ensure you have access to a local REDCap license and a 
running REDCap server. For more information, visit the official REDCap site: 
[https://projectredcap.org/partners/join/](https://projectredcap.org/partners/join/). 
If your institution already provides a REDCap instance, proceed to the RareLink 
Documentation on [Setting Up a REDCap Project](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_installation/3_2_setup_redcap_project.html#).


## Installation

RareLink can be set up using various Python project management approaches. One
 common method is to use a virtual environment. Below is an example where the
  virtual environment is named `rarelink-venv`, but you can name it as you prefer:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

> **Note**: You need Python ≥3.10 but <3.13 to be able to use RareLink! 

Next, install rarelink through pypi...

```bash
pip install rarelink
```

... or clone the RareLink repository, navigate to its root directory, and
 install RareLink using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rarelink.git
cd rarelink
pip install .
```

If you want to install development dependencies (e.g., `pytest`), use:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

### Setting Up the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store your BioPortal API
 token securely. Add the following line:

```plaintext
BIOPORTAL_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

> You can create your free BioPortal account here: [https://bioportal.bioontology.org/](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)
 Then replace `your_api_token_here` with your actual BioPortal API token. 

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is set up correctly, run the test suite using `pytest` (this
may take a while...):

```bash
pytest
```

---

### Notes

- Ensure that your `.env` file is not committed to version control by adding
 it to `.gitignore`.
- If you encounter issues, verify you are using the correct Python version and
 have installed all dependencies properly.

### Framework setup 

To ensure you have the latest version of RareLink installed and to check the current version, run:
```bash
rarelink framework update
rarelink framework status
```

### REDCap setup

To set up your local REDCap project, run:
```bash
rarelink setup redcap-project
```

For additional setup guidance, use:
```bash
rarelink setup --help
```

This will provide details about available commands, such as:

- `rarelink setup keys` for configuring, viewing, or 
  reseting your local API config file.
- `rarelink setup download-records --help` for downloading RareLink REDCap sheets.
- `rarelink setup data-dictionary` to upload the RareLink-CDM sheets 
  to your REDCap project.

> **Note**: Ensure that your local REDCap administrator has granted you API 
  access to your REDCap project. Remember that the API token is sensitive 
  information, so store it securely!

### Semi-Automated Import to REDCap

To process and import your local (tabular) rare disease datasets into your 
RareLink REDCap project, refer to the user guide on 
[Semi-Automatic Data Capture](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_2_import_mapper.html).
