# Welcome to the RareLink Implementation Guide

Welcome to the RareLink Implementation Guide – a non-balloted extension of the [European Rare Disease Infrastructure Common Data Set (ERDRI-CDS)](https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/set-of-common-data-elements_en). RareLink is a novel, open-source, and REDCap-based framework linking international registries to HL7 FHIR R4 and  GA4GH Phenopackets to enable rare disease data interoperability.

### Scope and Objectives

The RareLink project aims to:

- **Enhance** interoperability in data capture for rare disease registries using REDCap forms preconfigured with ontology-based instruments.  
- **Automate** transformation of REDCap records and import of retrospective data into interoperable formats (FHIR resources and Phenopacket JSON) for downstream analysis and data sharing.  
- **Extend** the ERDRI-CDS by utilising the ontology-based rare disease common data model, and its corresponding RareLink Common Data Model (RareLink-CDM) with accompanying FHIR profiles and value sets.  
- **Facilitate** cross-registry research and clinical workflows by leveraging HL7 IPS and Genomics Reporting dependencies and facilitating the use of Phenopacket-based analysis tools.

### Background

The RareLink framework builds on the novel Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD-CDM) [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04558-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04558-z) harmonising the ERDRI-CDS with HL7 FHIR and GA4GH Phenopackets to enable standardized data exchange across registries and analysis tools.

### RareLink Software Architecture

RareLink consists of:
1. [The RareLink Documentation](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) centralising all components of the RareLink framework, installation and user guides, as well as background and additional information.
2. **The RareLink-CDM**: its corresponding REDCap data dictionary can be imported into any REDCap project with each instrument displaying a section within the RD-CDM for manual data entry of [LinkML-based](https://linkml.io/) semi-automatic data capture. The profiles in this implementation guide represent the entire RareLink-CDM with all elements of the RD-CDM mapped to FHIR elements and can also be used for import via the [Clinical Data Interoperability Services](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421002008).
3. **A command-line interface (CLI)** (`rarelink`) interacting with the API of a local REDCap for:
   - REDCap API authentication, setup, and framework settings
   - Interaction with REDCap to download or upload records or setup the data dictionary
   - Setup of a Hapi-server and directly exporting RareLink-CDM data to FHIR resources
   - Downloading of GA4GH Phenopackets

Further details on semi-automatic or manual data capture, FHIR import via CIDS, the CLI, the FHIR and Phenopackets module can be found in our [RareLink documentation](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

> **Note:** The RareLink-CDM and its FHIR profiles are provided as a non-balloted extension of the [ERDRI-CDS](https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/set-of-common-data-elements_en).

### Balloting status

The RareLink-CDM FHIR profiles and Implementation Guide remain in draft trial-use status and subject to formal governance—including versioning, conformance testing, stakeholder review, and the incorporation of changes arising from the ballot process—before achieving formal approval. 

### Example Instances

Validated example instances of all profiles are available in the repository:

- [Bundle of example instances](https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rarelink/blob/develop/src/fsh/input/fsh/Bundle-rarelink-example.json)
- [Simulated evaluation cohort instances](https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rarelink/tree/develop/res/evaluation_cohort/fhir)
