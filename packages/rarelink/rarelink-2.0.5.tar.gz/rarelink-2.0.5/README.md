## Project Description

RareLink is a novel rare disease framework based on REDCap that connects 
international registries, FHIR, and Phenopackets. It provides comprehensive 
documentation and user guides to enable sustainable data management for your 
local rare disease REDCap project.

Built on the [RD-CDM](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html), 
all RareLink-CDM pipelines are preconfigured to generate FHIR resources compliant
with the [HL7 International Patient Summary](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/) 
, [HL7 Genomics Reporting profiles](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/) 
or validated GA4GH Phenopackets. For disease-specific extensions, detailed guides  
are available to help you develop sheets that integrate seamlessly with the 
RareLink framework.

If you are familiar with REDCap but lack coding experience, you can still set up 
your local RareLink REDCap project and begin capturing data. However, some coding 
experience is recommended for accessing advanced functionalities.

## Features

REDCap is a widely-used clinical electronic data capture system, licensed by 
institutions worldwide. RareLink enhances REDCap by providing detailed 
guidelines for structuring and encoding data to ensure seamless integration 
with its preconfigured FHIR and Phenopacket pipelines. Built on the 
[Rare Disease Common Data Model v2.0 (RD-CDM)](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html)
RareLink is ready-to-use and extensible for disease-specific requirements.

![RareLink Overview](docs/_static/res/rarelink_overview.png)

RareLink integrates the following features for rare disease data management in 
REDCap: 

1. **RareLink CLI**: Set up and manage your project via the 
   [Command Line Interface](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_rarelink_framework/2_4_rarelink_cli.html), 
   including API setup, instrument configuration, and running FHIR or Phenopacket 
   pipelines.
2. **Native REDCap Usage**: Downloadable REDCap forms for all [RD-CDM sections](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html), 
   complete with installation guides and manuals for manual data capture and 
   BioPortal connection.
3. **Semi-Automated Data Capture**: Use a template script to map your tabular
   data to the RareLink-CDM, which is in [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/).
   This process includes syntactic mapping, local semantic encoding, validation,
   and data upload to REDCap for FHIR or Phenopacket export.
4. **RareLink-Phenopacket Engine**: Predefined configurations enable seamless 
   export of the RD-CDM data and extensions to validated Phenopackets -> [User Guide](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_3_phenopackets.html).
5. **HL7 FHIR Export**: RareLink uses the open-source 
   [_toFHIR_ Engine](https://github.com/srdc/tofhir) to export data to any FHIR 
   server, supporting profiles based on the 
   [HL7 International Patient Summary v2.0.0](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/),
   the [HL7 GenomicsReporting v3.0.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/STU3/index.html)
   and FHIR Base Resources (v4.0.1).
   - [RareLink FHIR Implementation Guide in draft](https://bih-cei.github.io/rarelink/) 
6. **Customising RareLink & RD-CDM Extensions**: [Guidelines for modeling and encoding custom data](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_5_develop_redcap_instruments.html)
   extensions ensure compatibility with the RareLink framework and its pipelines.

## Getting Started

Begin by exploring the RareLink [Background section](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_0_background_file.html) 
to understand the framework's scope and components.

To start using RareLink, ensure you have access to a local REDCap license and a 
running REDCap server. For more information, visit the official REDCap site: 
[https://projectredcap.org/partners/join/](https://projectredcap.org/partners/join/). 
If your institution already provides a REDCap instance, proceed to the RareLink 
Documentation on [Setting Up a REDCap Project](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_installation/3_2_setup_redcap_project.html#).


## Installation

RareLink can be set up using various Python project management approaches. One
 common method is to use a virtual environment. Below is an example where the
  virtual environment is named `rarelink-venv`, but you can name it as you prefer:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

> **Note**: You need Python ≥3.10 but <3.13 to be able to use RareLink! 

Next, install rarelink through pypi...

```bash
pip install rarelink
```

... or clone the RareLink repository, navigate to its root directory, and
 install RareLink using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rarelink.git
cd rarelink
pip install .
```

If you want to install development dependencies (e.g., `pytest`), use:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

### Setting Up the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store your BioPortal API
 token securely. Add the following line:

```plaintext
BIOPORTAL_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

> You can create your free BioPortal account here: [https://bioportal.bioontology.org/](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)
 Then replace `your_api_token_here` with your actual BioPortal API token. 

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is set up correctly, run the test suite using `pytest` (this
may take a while...):

```bash
pytest
```

---

### Notes

- Ensure that your `.env` file is not committed to version control by adding
 it to `.gitignore`.
- If you encounter issues, verify you are using the correct Python version and
 have installed all dependencies properly.

### Framework setup 

To ensure you have the latest version of RareLink installed and to check the current version, run:
```bash
rarelink framework update
rarelink framework status
```

### REDCap setup

To set up your local REDCap project, run:
```bash
rarelink setup redcap-project
```

For additional setup guidance, use:
```bash
rarelink setup --help
```

This will provide details about available commands, such as:

- `rarelink setup keys` for configuring, viewing, or 
  reseting your local API config file.
- `rarelink setup download-records --help` for downloading RareLink REDCap sheets.
- `rarelink setup data-dictionary` to upload the RareLink-CDM sheets 
  to your REDCap project.

> **Note**: Ensure that your local REDCap administrator has granted you API 
  access to your REDCap project. Remember that the API token is sensitive 
  information, so store it securely!

### Semi-Automated Import to REDCap

To process and import your local (tabular) rare disease datasets into your 
RareLink REDCap project, refer to the user guide on 
[Semi-Automatic Data Capture](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_2_import_mapper.html).

### Export REDCap Data to FHIR

To export [IPS](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/)-based FHIR resources to 
your local FHIR server, refer to the user guide on the 
[IPS RareLink FHIR Export](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tofhir_module.html).

### Export REDCap Data to Phenopackets

To export your REDCap RareLink data to validated Phenopackets, refer to the user 
guide on the 
[RareLink Phenopacket Export](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_3_phenopacket_mapper.html).

### Extensional Data Modeling in REDCap

To develop your local REDCap database for disease-specific extensions around the 
[RD-CDM](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_background/1_5_rd_cdm.html), 
refer to the guide on how to develop and model REDCap sheets for processing by 
the RareLink framework: 
[RD-CDM RareLink Extension Guide](https://rarelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_user_guide/4_5_develop_redcap_instruments.html).
