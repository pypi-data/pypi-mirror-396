# homey-stubs

Type annotations for the Homey SDK

### Static type-checkers
These types have been tested with:
- [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) version 1.1.406

A static type-checking package is not required, however, and these stubs will still improve autocomplete suggestions
and error detection in your IDE if you don't install one.

### Example

The following example illustrates some situations that will be caught by pyright.

```python
from homey.driver import Driver
from homey.flow_card_trigger_device import FlowCardTriggerDevice

class  MyDriver(Driver):
    async def on_init(self) -> None:
        # Type "FlowCardTrigger" is not assignable to declared type "FlowCardTriggerDevice"
        trigger_card: FlowCardTriggerDevice = self.homey.flow.get_trigger_card("something_happens")
        some_token = await self.homey.flow.create_token("some_token", "number", "Some token")
        # Type "Literal['value']" is not assignable to type "float | None"
        await some_token.set_value("value")

```
