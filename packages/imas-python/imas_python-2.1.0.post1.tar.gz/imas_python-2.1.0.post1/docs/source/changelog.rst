What's new in IMAS-Python 2.0.0
-------------------------------

Breaking change
'''''''''''''''

The package name was changed from ``imaspy`` to ``imas`` while porting the code to `GitHub <https://github.com/iterorganization/IMAS-Python>`__. This shall only affect the import statements in your code. 

New features and improvements
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Add :py:func:`imas.util.to_xarray` to convert a full IDS or only specific paths herein to a Xarray ``Dataset``. See :ref:`Convert IMAS-Python IDSs directly to Xarray Datasets` for more details.
- Implements automatic DD version conversion on :py:meth:`imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get` (conversion during :py:meth:`imas.db_entry.DBEntry.put` is not supported as this is rarely needed and easily worked around).
- Enable lazy loading when reading data from a netCDF file.
- Minor performance improvement loading data from a netCDF file.
- Replace versioneer by setuptools-scm to determine the version of the code.
- Use `saxonche <https://pypi.org/project/saxonche/>`__ instead of the JAR for XSL transforms (when building versions of the DD).
- Updating the README, CONTRIBUTING guidelines and documentation after making the code open access.


What's new in IMASPy 1.2.0
-------------------------------

- Extend the support of netCDF to >= 1.4.1 (without complex numbers)
- Allow running test without imas_core
  
Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Fix a bug when lazy loading multiple IDSs from the same HDF5 DBEntry
- Fix a bug when lazy loading a child quantity that was added in a newer DD version than stored on disk



What's new in IMASPy 1.1.1
-------------------------------

This is a small release that mainly fixes issues related to the recent Data
Dictionary 4.0.0 release.

Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Data Dictionary 4.0.0 compatibility:

  - Fix a bug with ``get_slice`` and ``put_slice`` not correctly slicing data.
  - Update tests and examples. Some were updated to be compatible with both Data
    Dictionary 4.0.0 and 3.42.0. In other cases, the Data Dictionary version is
    now explicitly indicated.

- IMAS-5560: Fix a bug where IMASPy would not correctly recognize that
  the UDA backend is used.
- IMAS-5541: Fix a bug when converting a closed contour to Data
  Dictionary version 4.0.0.
- Work around incorrect Data Dictionary 3.x metadata when converting
  ``flux_loop/flux`` in the ``magnetics`` IDS to Data Dictionary version 4.0.0.
- Fix a bug when lazy loading Arrays of Structures that where added in a more
  recent Data Dictionary version than the on-disk data was stored with.


What's new in IMASPy 1.1
-----------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

- :ref:`1.1/improved performance`.
- :ref:`1.1/improved conversion`.
- IMASPy 1.1 adds support for Identifiers defined by the Data Dictionary. This
  functionality is described in detail in :ref:`Identifiers`.
- Support for the new
  :py:const:`~imas.ids_defs.FLEXBUFFERS_SERIALIZER_PROTOCOL` that is
  implemented in Access Layer Core 5.3. This is a much faster and more efficient
  serialization format than the
  :py:const:`~imas.ids_defs.ASCII_SERIALIZER_PROTOCOL`. The Flexbuffers
  serializer protocol requires ``imas_core`` version 5.3 or newer. It is the
  default serializer format when it is available. This features is not available
  when the variable :py:const:`~imas.ids_defs.FLEXBUFFERS_SERIALIZER_PROTOCOL`
  is set to ``None``.
- Preview feature: :ref:`IMAS netCDF files`. Store IDSs in a self-describing
  netCDF file, which can be used for sharing and/or archiving data.
  
  This feature is in `preview` status, meaning that it may change in upcoming
  minor releases of IMASPy.

- Additional utility functions in :py:mod:`imas.util`:

  - :py:func:`imas.util.tree_iter` can be used to iterate over all nodes inside
    an IDS.
  - :py:func:`imas.util.get_parent` can be used to get the parent element of
    an IDS node.
  - :py:func:`imas.util.get_time_mode` is a convenience function to get the
    ``ids_properties/homogeneous_time`` value for any node in the IDS.
  - :py:func:`imas.util.get_toplevel` returns the IDS Toplevel element for any
    node in the IDS.
  - :py:func:`imas.util.is_lazy_loaded` will indicate whether an IDS is lazy
    loaded.
  - :py:func:`imas.util.get_full_path` returns the full path (including Array
    of Structure indices) of a node.
  - :py:func:`imas.util.get_data_dictionary_version` returns the Data
    Dictionary version for which an IDS was created.

- Add support for IMAS Access Layer Core 5.2 and later. IMASPy can now be used
  with just the Access Layer Core package available, the full AL-Python HLI is
  no longer required.

  Since the Access Layer Core is now installable with ``pip`` as well (requires
  access to the git repository on
  `<https://git.iter.org/projects/IMAS/repos/al-core/>`__), you can install
  ``imaspy`` and ``imas_core`` in one go with:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pip install 'imaspy[imas-core] @ git+ssh://git@git.iter.org/imas/imaspy.git'

- A diff tool for IDSs: :py:func:`imas.util.idsdiff`.
- Implement ``==`` equality checking for IDS Structures and Arrays of Structures
  (`IMAS-5120 <https://jira.iter.org/browse/IMAS-5120>`__).
- Add option to ignore unknown Data Dictionary versions of data stored in the
  backend.

  During a :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get` or
  :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get_slice`, IMASPy first reads the version
  of the Data Dictionary that was used to store the IDS. When this version is
  not known to IMASPy, an error is raised. This error can now be ignored by
  setting the parameter
  :py:param:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get.ignore_unknown_dd_version` to
  ``True``, and IMASPy will do its best to load the data anyway.

- A new command line tool exists for analyzing which Data Dictionary fields are
  used in provided Data Entries. This tool is explained in detail in
  :ref:`IMAS-Python Data Entry analysis`.

- Various improvements to the documentation were made.


Breaking changes
''''''''''''''''

.. note::

  We attempt to keep the public API of IMASPy stable with minor releases. The
  following breaking change is the result of an upgrade of the IMAS Access Layer.

- Starting with Access Layer 5.2 or newer, the Access Layer will raise
  exceptions when errors occur in the ``imas_core`` layer. For example, when
  attempting to read from non-existing Data Entries or when a Data Entry cannot
  be opened for writing data.

  You may need to update the :py:class:`Exception` classes in ``try/except``
  blocks to the new Exception classes raised by ``imas_core``.

  When using an older version of the Access Layer, the behaviour of IMASPy is no
  different than in IMASPy 1.0.


Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Fixed a bug in :py:func:`imas.util.inspect` when inspecting lazy loaded IDSs.
- Fixed a bug when converting the ``neutron_diagnostics`` IDS to/from Data
  Dictionary version ``3.41.0``.
- Fixed a bug that allowed setting arbitrary attributes on IDS structures. It is
  only allowed to use attributes defined by the Data Dictionary.
- Fixed a bug with :py:func:`~imas.ids_toplevel.IDSToplevel.serialize` when
  the IDS is in a non-default Data Dictionary version.
- Fixed a bug when assigning ``nan`` to a FLT_0D, which would lead to a
  confusing and incorrect log message in IMASPy 1.0.
- Fixed incorrect oldest supported DD version. Previously IMASPy indicated that
  DD ``3.21.1`` was supported, however ``3.22.0`` is the oldest Data Dictionary
  tested (and provided) with IMASPy. :py:attr:`imas.OLDEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION`
  has been updated to reflect this.
- Fixed a bug when using numpy functions, such as
  :external:py:func:`numpy.isclose` on scalar numbers. Previously an error was
  raised (``TypeError: ufunc 'isfinite' not supported for the input types, and
  the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the
  casting rule ''safe''``), now this works as expected.
- Fixed bugs that relied on the presence of the environment variables ``USER``,
  ``PATH`` and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. Although these are defined most of the time
  on Linux systems, they can be empty and this is now handled correctly.



.. _`1.1/improved performance`:

Improved performance
''''''''''''''''''''

- Improved performance of :py:meth:`~imas.ids_toplevel.IDSToplevel.validate`.
- Improved creation of IMASPy IDS objects. This made filling IDSs and loading
  them with :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get` /
  :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get_slice` 10-20% faster.
- Improved the performance of lazy loading. This is most noticeable with the
  ``HDF5`` backend, which is now up to 40x faster than with IMASPy 1.0.
- Improved the performance of :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get` /
  :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.get_slice` /
  :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.put` /
  :py:meth:`~imas.db_entry.DBEntry.put_slice` for IDSs with many nested arrays
  of structures. This performance improvement is most noticeable for IDSs with
  filled GGD grids and data structures (up to 25% faster).


.. _`1.1/improved conversion`:

Improved IDS conversion between Data Dictionary versions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Converting IDSs between Data Dictionary versions has several improvements for
recent DD versions. Further details on IDS conversion can be found in
:ref:`Conversion of IDSs between DD versions`.

- The IMASPy Command Line Interface for converting Data Entries between different
  versions of the Data Dictionary has been improved. See :ref:`Command line tool
  reference` or execute ``imas convert --help`` in a shell for further
  details.

- Add support for multiple renames in an IDS' path.

  For example, in the ``pulse_schedule`` IDS, the node
  ``ec/beam/power_launched/reference`` in Data Dictionary ``3.40.0`` was renamed
  from ``ec/launcher/power/reference/data`` in Data Dictionary ``3.39.0``. This
  use case is now supported by IMASPy.

- Automatically convert data between 0D and 1D when possible (`IMAS-5170
  <https://jira.iter.org/browse/IMAS-5170>`__).
  The following type changes are now automatically supported by
  :py:func:`imas.convert_ids <imas.ids_convert.convert_ids>`:

  - INT_0D to INT_1D
  - FLT_0D to FLT_1D
  - CPX_0D to CPX_1D
  - STR_0D to STR_1D
  - Structure to Array of structures

  See :ref:`Supported conversions` for more details.

- Add data conversion from Data Dictionary version 3.x to Data Dictionary
  version 4.x:

  - Convert changed COCOS definitions: automatically multiply nodes that have
    changed their COCOS definition with ``-1``.
  - Convert changed definition of ``circuit(i1)/connection`` in the
    ``pf_active`` IDS.
  - Convert changed definition of open/closed contours.
  - Convert changed definition of ``space/coordinates_type`` in GGD grid structures.
