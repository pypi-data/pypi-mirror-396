# Interoperability

CEP is designed to integrate with: 

- Popolo - the entity + political relationships backbone of nearly every open civics project worldwide (OCD, OpenStates, etc.) includes models for Person, Organization, Membership, 
Post / Role, Area, Event, Motion / Vote, Legislative Activity and works for elected officials, models boards, committees, councils, includes membership graph.
- Open Civic Data
- Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) - international standard for public procurement, contracts, tenders, awards, suppliers, implementation and milestone tracking.
- Schema.org - includes Organization, Person, Place, GovernmentOrganization, Grant, MonetaryGrant, 
Legislation, VoteAction and enables interoperability with Google datasets, machine readability.
- Financial Taxonomies (XBRL) - good for financial reporting, auditing, interoperability with Treasury and state finance systems
- W3C PROV - good for academics and auditors, PROV guides revision chains, attestation blocks, canonical timestamps, and hash-based integrity. CEP attestation maps to PROV wasGeneratedBy, wasAttributedTo, wasDerivedFrom and CEP previousRecordHash maps to PROV wasRevisionOf.
- Open Referral Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) - has Organization, Location, Service, Funding - enables connecting public funding to outcomes
- Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) - map to loan-agreement, grant-award (loosely), subsidiary.
