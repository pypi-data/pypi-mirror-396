# - "abbreviations" is token-based expansion (single-token keys only).
# - Use "agency_names" for aliases that should match across word boundaries.
# - Use "rules" for regex/literal cleanup and edge-case rewrites.
# - This file should remain conservative; jurisdiction-specific rules live in child configs.
