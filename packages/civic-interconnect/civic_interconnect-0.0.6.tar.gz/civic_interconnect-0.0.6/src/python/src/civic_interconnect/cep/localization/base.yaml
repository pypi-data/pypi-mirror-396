# CEP Localization Rules
# Jurisdiction: BASE
# Parent: null
#
# Notes:
# - This file is intentionally minimal and provides the absolute default configuration.
# - Prefer putting general-purpose normalization/cleanup rules in the US file (or other country base),
#   not here, so BASE stays globally safe.
# - Keys should be stable and deterministic; keep this YAML strictly well-formed.
