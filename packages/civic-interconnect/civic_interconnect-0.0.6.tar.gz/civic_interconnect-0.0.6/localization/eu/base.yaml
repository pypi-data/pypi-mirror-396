# CEP Localization Rules
# Jurisdiction: EU
# Parent: BASE
#
# Scope:
# - Conservative, cross-country normalization for Europe-wide datasets.
# - Avoid language-specific or country-specific aggressive rewrites.
# - Prefer “make tokenization stable” over “guess meaning”.
#
# Design principles:
# - Never remove content unless it is clearly non-semantic (wrappers, trailing boilerplate, formatting noise).
# - Avoid expansions that could change meaning across languages.
# - Keep rules deterministic and idempotent.

# Keep abbreviations conservative at EU level.
# Country- or language-specific abbreviations should live in eu/de, eu/fr, etc.
abbreviations:
  eu: european union

agency_names: {}

entity_types:
  # Extremely common organizational categories across EU contexts.
  # Keep these as identity-stable labels rather than expansions that remove signal.
  ngo: non-governmental organization

rules:
  # 1) Normalize common punctuation that breaks tokenization
  - pattern: ","
    replacement: " "
    is_regex: false

  # 2) Strip trailing punctuation (often present in vendor lists)
  - pattern: "[,.;:]+\\s*$"
    replacement: ""
    is_regex: true

  # 3) Collapse whitespace
  - pattern: "\\s+"
    replacement: " "
    is_regex: true

  # 4) Trim leading/trailing whitespace (post-processing usually handles this, but keep it explicit)
  - pattern: "^\\s+|\\s+$"
    replacement: ""
    is_regex: true

  # 5) Normalize common bracketed country markers when they are clearly wrappers
  #    Examples: "acme (eu)" / "acme [eu]" -> "acme"
  - pattern: "\\s*[\\(\\[]\\s*eu\\s*[\\)\\]]\\s*$"
    replacement: ""
    is_regex: true

  # 6) Remove repeated hyphen/underscore noise used as separators in some exports
  #    Example: "acme --- partners" -> "acme partners"
  - pattern: "[-_]{2,}"
    replacement: " "
    is_regex: true

  # 7) Normalize ampersand spacing only (do not remove & at EU base)
  #    Example: "a&b" -> "a & b"
  - pattern: "\\s*&\\s*"
    replacement: " & "
    is_regex: true
