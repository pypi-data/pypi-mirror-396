# django-availability

Reusable Django app for modelling provider/resource availability with weekly hours, breaks, one-off exceptions, and optional tenant-wide holidays. It answers “when can this provider be booked?” and stays out of booking/slot generation concerns.

## Features
- Weekly recurring working windows per provider
- Recurring breaks inside working windows
- Exceptions for closed days and special hours
- Optional tenant holidays (enabled when a tenant model is configured)
- Timezone-safe selectors that return aware datetimes
- Admin UX tuned for day-of-week workflows

## Installation
1) Add the package and Django to your project (Django 4.2+):
```bash
pip install django-availability
```

2) Configure settings:
- `AVAILABILITY_PROVIDER_MODEL` (required): the provider model as `app_label.ModelName` (default: `"providers.Provider"`).
- `AVAILABILITY_TENANT_MODEL` (optional): tenant model as `app_label.ModelName`. When set, tenant FKs are added to models and TenantHoliday is enabled.

3) Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "availability",
]
```

4) Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Models
- `WeeklyAvailability`: recurring weekly working windows (weekday, start_time, end_time, is_active, sort_order).
- `AvailabilityBreak`: recurring breaks per weekday that subtract from working windows.
- `AvailabilityException`: one-off CLOSED or SPECIAL_HOURS per date; unique per provider+date.
- `TenantHoliday` (tenant mode only): tenant-wide closed dates.

Validation rules:
- `end_time` must be after `start_time`.
- Active weekly windows/breaks cannot overlap for a provider+weekday.
- SPECIAL_HOURS require start/end; CLOSED must not provide times.
- Tenant consistency enforced when `AVAILABILITY_TENANT_MODEL` is set.

## Public API (selectors)
Import from `availability.selectors`:
- `get_working_windows_for_date(provider, date, tz=None) -> list[(start_dt, end_dt)]`
- `get_working_windows(provider, start_date, end_date, tz=None) -> dict[date, list[(start_dt, end_dt)]]`
- `is_provider_available(provider, dt, tz=None) -> bool`

Example:
```python
from datetime import date, datetime
from django.utils import timezone
from availability.selectors import get_working_windows_for_date, is_provider_available

provider = ...
target_date = date(2024, 1, 1)
tz = timezone.get_current_timezone()

windows = get_working_windows_for_date(provider, target_date, tz=tz)
if is_provider_available(provider, datetime(2024, 1, 1, 10, 30), tz=tz):
    print("open")
```

The selectors:
- honor CLOSED/SPECIAL_HOURS exceptions
- subtract breaks from weekly or special-hour windows
- close days that fall on tenant holidays (if enabled)
- return timezone-aware datetimes; `tz` defaults to Django’s current timezone

## Admin
Admin list filters cover weekday/kind/tenant and call `full_clean()` on save for safety. Ordering is optimized for weekday flows.

## Testing locally
This repo ships a minimal test project. Run:
```bash
python test availability
```
The helper script pins `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tests.settings` so the bundled test provider/tenant models are used. You can pass other labels, e.g. `python test tests`.

## Releasing to PyPI
1) **Bump version**: update `pyproject.toml` (and `availability/__init__.py` if mirroring).
2) **Clean dist**: remove old artifacts: `rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info`.
3) **Build**:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
python -m build
```
4) **Check**: `python -m twine check dist/*`.
5) **Publish** (replace token): `python -m twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p pypi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
   - For TestPyPI: `python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`.
6) **Verify install** (optional): `pip install --no-cache-dir django-availability`.

## Scope notes
- No booking/slot generation/payment/notification logic.
- Datetimes are expected/stored in UTC; local rules are weekday + local times.
- Overnight windows are not supported in v0.
