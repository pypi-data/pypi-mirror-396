# QNote

QNote is a terminal-based, local-first note-taking app powered by [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).
It provides a fast, intuitive, keyboard-driven way to capture and manage notes — all without leaving your terminal.

## Why another note-taking app?

Because taking a quick note shouldn’t feel like a project.

Most note apps make you:
- choose a notebook
- choose a folder
- choose a tag
- choose a title
- confirm sync
- worry about the cloud

…and somehow your note still gets lost later

QNote fixes that by staying out of your way.

- No accounts
- No cloud
- No decisions
- No ceremony

Just:

- One command to install
- One command to launch (or startup)
- One hotkey → type → done

Your notes stay local, fast, and easy to navigate with simple categories and metadata that help you keep things tidy without effort.
