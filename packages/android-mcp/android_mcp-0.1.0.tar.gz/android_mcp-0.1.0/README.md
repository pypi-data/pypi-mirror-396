**Android-MCP** is a lightweight, open-source tool that bridge between AI agents and Android devices. Running as an MCP server, it lets LLM agents perform real-world tasks such as **app navigation, UI interaction and automated QA testing** without relying on traditional computer-vision pipelines or preprogramed scripts.

## ✨ Features

- **Native Android Integration**  
  Interact with UI elements via ADB and the Android Accessibility API: launch apps, tap, swipe, input text, and read view hierarchies.

- **Bring Your Own LLM/VLM**  
  Works with any language model, no fine-tuned CV model or OCR pipeline required.

- **Rich Toolset for Mobile Automation**  
  Pre-built tools for gestures, keystrokes, capture, device state, shell commands execution.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., two taps) ranges **2-4s** depending on device specs and load.

### Supported Operating Systems

- Android 10+

## Installation

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- UIautomator2
- Android 10+ (Emulator/ Android Device)
- A computer to run MCP server

### 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/CursorTouch/Android-MCP.git
   cd Android-MCP
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```shell
   uv python install 3.10
   uv sync
```

3. **Connect to the MCP server**

1. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:

  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following JSON to your Claude Desktop config:

  ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "android-mcp": {
          "command": "path/to/uv",
          "args": [
            "--directory",
            "path/to/Android-MCP",
            "run",
            "main.py",
            "--emulator"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ```
  Replace:
  - `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your uv executable
  - `path/to/Android-MCP` with the absolute path to where you have cloned this repo

  NOTE: `--emulator` this is used to run in emulator, remove it to use actual device

3. **Restart the Claude Desktop**

Restart your Claude Desktop. You should see "android-mcp" listed as an available integration. That's it, now you're ready to start controlling your Android device with natural language.

For troubleshooting tips (log locations, common ADB issues), see the [MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#android-mcp-integration-issues).
