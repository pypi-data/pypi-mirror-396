    """A pass is a transformation that is applied to a method. It wraps
    the analysis and rewrites needed to transform the method as an independent
    unit.

    Unlike LLVM/MLIR passes, a pass in Kirin does not apply to a module,
    this is because we focus on individual methods defined within
    python modules. This is a design choice to allow seamless integration
    within the Python interpreter.

    A Kirin compile unit is a `ir.Method` object, which is always equivalent
    to a LLVM/MLIR module if it were lowered to LLVM/MLIR just like other JIT
    compilers.
