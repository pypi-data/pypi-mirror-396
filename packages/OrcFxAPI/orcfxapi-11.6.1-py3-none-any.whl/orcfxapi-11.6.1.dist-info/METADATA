Python interface to the OrcaFlex API
====================================

OrcaFlex (https://www.orcina.com/orcaflex/), developed by Orcina Ltd.
(https://www.orcina.com/), is a finite element analysis tool used primarily for offshore engineering.
OrcaFlex has a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) that makes tasks such as model development
very efficient.

The program also offers a number of methods to automate its use. These range from
Excel based automation facilities to the low-level programming interface, known as OrcFxAPI.
Interfaces with a number of different programming languages are available. At the time of writing
these languages are: C, C++, C#, Delphi, Matlab and Python.

This package implements the Python interface to the OrcaFlex API. Documentation can be found
