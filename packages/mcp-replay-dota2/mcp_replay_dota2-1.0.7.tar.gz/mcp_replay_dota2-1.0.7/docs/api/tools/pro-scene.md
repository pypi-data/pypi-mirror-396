## get_pro_matches

Get recent professional matches with series grouping. By default returns ALL matches including low-tier leagues - use filters to narrow down results.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `limit` | int | Maximum matches to return (default: 100) |
| `tier` | string | Filter by league tier: `"premium"` (TI, Majors), `"professional"`, or `"amateur"` |
| `team1_name` | string | Filter by first team (fuzzy match). Alone: returns all matches for that team |
| `team2_name` | string | Filter by second team (fuzzy match). With team1: returns head-to-head matches |
| `league_name` | string | Contains match on league name (e.g., "SLAM", "ESL", "DreamLeague") |
| `days_back` | int | Only return matches from the last N days |

**Team Filtering:**

- **Single team** (`team1_name` only): Returns all matches involving that team (either radiant or dire)
- **Head-to-head** (`team1_name` + `team2_name`): Returns only matches where both teams played against each other, regardless of which side (radiant/dire) they were on

**Data Blending:** When team filters are provided, this tool automatically blends data from two sources:

1. **Team-specific endpoint** (`/teams/{id}/matches`) - captures matches that OpenDota's `/proMatches` often misses (e.g., major tournaments like SLAM)
2. **General pro matches** (`/proMatches`) - provides broader coverage

This ensures comprehensive results when searching for specific teams.

```python
# Get top-tier tournament matches only
get_pro_matches(tier="premium")

# Find all matches for a specific team
get_pro_matches(team1_name="Tundra", days_back=7)

# Find head-to-head matches between two teams
get_pro_matches(team1_name="Team Spirit", team2_name="OG")

# Head-to-head at a specific tournament
get_pro_matches(team1_name="Spirit", team2_name="OG", league_name="International")

# Find matches in a specific tournament
get_pro_matches(league_name="SLAM")

# Combine filters: team matches at premium tournaments
get_pro_matches(tier="premium", team1_name="Team Spirit", days_back=30)
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total_matches": 100,
  "series": [...],
  "matches": [
    {
      "match_id": 8461956309,
      "radiant_team_id": 8291895,
