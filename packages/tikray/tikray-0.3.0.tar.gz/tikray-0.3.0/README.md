## About

Tikray is a generic and compact **transformation engine** written in Python, for data
decoding, encoding, conversion, translation, transformation, and cleansing purposes,
to be used as a pipeline element for data pre- or post-processing, or as a standalone
converter program.

## Details

A data model and implementation for a compact transformation engine based on
[JMESPath], [jq], [JSON Pointer] (RFC 6901), [rsonpath], [transon], and [DWIM].

The reference implementation is written in [Python], using [attrs] and [cattrs].
The design, conventions, and definitions also encourage implementations
in other programming languages.

## Installation

The package is available from [PyPI] at [tikray].
To install the most recent version, invoke:
```shell
uv pip install --upgrade 'tikray'
```

## Usage

In order to learn how to use the library, please visit the [documentation],
and explore the source code or its [examples].

### Acknowledgements
Kudos to the authors of all the many software components this library is
vendoring and building upon.

### Similar Projects

specifically [an introduction and overview about Singer].

### Contributing
The `tikray` package is an open source project, and is
[managed on GitHub]. The project is still in its infancy, and
we appreciate contributions of any kind.

### Etymology
Tikray means "transform" in the [Quechua language].
A previous version used the name `zyp`,
with kudos to [Kris Zyp] for conceiving [JSON Pointer].
