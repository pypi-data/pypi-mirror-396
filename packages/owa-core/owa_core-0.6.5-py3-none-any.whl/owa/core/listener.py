"""
This module provides classes for handling environment state acquisition and action execution.

Two main concepts are introduced:
1. Callable - Defines functions that acquire state or perform actions, called by the user.
2. Listener - Provides interfaces for the environment to call user-defined functions.

The key difference between these two is who initiates the call:
- Callable is actively called by the user
- Listener is passively waiting for events and then calls user-provided callbacks

class ListenerMixin(RunnableMixin):
    """
    A mixin class that provides callback registration and invocation functionality.

    ListenerMixin extends RunnableMixin to add the ability to register a callback
    function that will be called when the listener detects an event. This provides
    a standard interface for environment-triggered calls to user-defined functions.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Define a callback function to be called when events are detected
        def on_event(data):
            print(f"Event detected: {data}")

        # Create a custom listener by inheriting from Listener
        class KeyboardListener(Listener):
            def loop(self, stop_event, callback):
                print("Listening for keyboard events...")
                while not stop_event.is_set():
                    # Simulate detecting an event
                    key_pressed = input("Press a key: ")
                    if key_pressed:
                        # Call the callback with the detected event data
                        callback({"key": key_pressed, "timestamp": time.time()})

                    # Check stop_event periodically
                    if stop_event.is_set():
                        break

        # Create and configure the listener with our callback
        listener = KeyboardListener().configure(callback=on_event)

        # Use the listener in a context manager
        with listener.session as active_listener:
            # The listener is now running in a separate thread
            # and will call on_event when keys are pressed
            time.sleep(30)  # Keep listening for 30 seconds

        # After exiting the context, the listener is stopped and joined
        ```
