"""
Subprocess management utility for running external processes as threads.

This module provides tools to run and manage external processes in a thread-safe manner,
with proper handling of termination signals and cleanup. The implementation supports
both Windows and Unix-like systems with platform-specific optimizations.

    DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION.
    Instead, pass CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP to the subprocess.Popen() function
    and send CTRL_BREAK_EVENT signal instead of CTRL_C_EVENT. CTRL_C_EVENT does NOT work.

    ===
    Disable Ctrl+C once. This function must be called before sending Ctrl+C to a process.
    Utilizing this function is not preferred, as this function must be called in main thread, which is not guaranteed in common.

    Thread-based runner for managing subprocesses with proper termination handling.

    This class extends RunnableThread to run external processes in a controlled manner,
    allowing clean shutdown and resource cleanup when the parent application terminates.
    It's particularly designed to handle Windows-specific process group behavior.
