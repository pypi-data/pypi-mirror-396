## Physics & Rendering

RayRoom implements multiple rendering strategies to model sound propagation accurately across different frequency bands and acoustic phenomena.

### 1. Ray Tracing (Stochastic)
Models sound as particles (rays) that bounce around the room.
- **Geometric Divergence**: Naturally handled by the divergence of rays.
- **Air Absorption**: ISO 9613-1 standard model based on temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- **Scattering**: Walls scatter rays based on their scattering coefficient.

### 2. Image Source Method (ISM)
Models specular reflections by mirroring sources across boundaries.
- **Purpose**: Captures precise early reflections (echoes) that are crucial for spatial perception.
- **Deterministic**: Unlike ray tracing, it finds exact reflection paths up to a specified order.

### 3. Acoustic Radiosity
A patch-based energy exchange method.
- **Purpose**: Models the late diffuse reverberation field.
- **Mechanism**: Divides walls into patches and solves the energy transfer matrix (view factors) to simulate diffuse inter-reflections.

### 4. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
Solves the acoustic wave equation on a 3D grid.
- **Purpose**: Accurate simulation of low-frequency phenomena like standing waves, diffraction, and interference which geometric methods (Ray/ISM) miss.
- **Mechanism**: Voxelizes the room and updates pressure fields over time steps.

### 5. Hybrid Engines
- **Hybrid Renderer**: Combines ISM (Early) and Ray Tracing (Late) for a complete impulse response.
- **Spectral Renderer**: Splits the audio spectrum. Uses **FDTD** for low frequencies (Wave physics) and **Hybrid Geometric** (ISM+Ray) for high frequencies.

pip install rayroom
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayroom/rayroom.git
cd rayroom
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Simple Shoebox Room with Audio Rendering

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.io import wavfile
from rayroom import Room, Source, Receiver, RaytracingRenderer

# 1. Create a shoebox room
room = Room.create_shoebox([5, 4, 3])

# 2. Add a sound source
source = Source("TestSource", [2.5, 2, 1.5], power=1.0)
room.add_source(source)

# 3. Add a receiver (microphone)
receiver = Receiver("TestMic", [1, 2, 1.5], radius=0.1)
room.add_receiver(receiver)

# 4. Set up the renderer
renderer = RaytracingRenderer(room, fs=44100)

# 5. Assign audio to the source
# Create a 1-second sine wave at 440 Hz
fs = 44100
duration = 1.0
t = np.linspace(0., duration, int(fs * duration), endpoint=False)
audio_data = 0.5 * np.sin(2. * np.pi * 440. * t)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, audio_data)

# 6. Run the simulation
outputs = renderer.render(n_rays=10000, max_hops=30, rir_duration=1.5)

# 7. Save the output
output_audio = outputs[receiver.name]
wavfile.write("output.wav", fs, (output_audio * 32767).astype(np.int16))

print("Simulation complete. Audio saved to output.wav")
```

### Hybrid Rendering (ISM + Ray Tracing)

Use the `HybridRenderer` to combine deterministic early reflections with stochastic late reverberation.

```python
from rayroom import HybridRenderer

# ... setup room ...

renderer = HybridRenderer(room, fs=44100)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

# ism_order=2 calculates exact reflections up to 2 bounces
outputs = renderer.render(n_rays=20000, ism_order=2)
```

### Spectral Rendering (Wave + Geometric)

Use the `SpectralRenderer` for high-fidelity simulation that accounts for wave physics at low frequencies.

```python
from rayroom import SpectralRenderer

# ... setup room ...

# crossover_freq determines where to switch from Wave to Geometric physics
renderer = SpectralRenderer(room, fs=44100, crossover_freq=1000)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

outputs = renderer.render(rir_duration=1.0)
```

### Radiosity Rendering (ISM + Diffuse Energy)

Use `RadiosityRenderer` for smooth diffuse tails without ray sampling noise.

```python
from rayroom import RadiosityRenderer

# ... setup room ...

renderer = RadiosityRenderer(room, fs=44100, patch_size=0.5)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

outputs = renderer.render(ism_order=2)
```

### Ambisonic Rendering

To render First-Order Ambisonic (FOA) audio, simply use an `AmbisonicReceiver`. The output will be a 4-channel audio file (W, X, Y, Z).

```python
from rayroom import AmbisonicReceiver

# ... setup room ...

# Use an Ambisonic receiver for FOA output
ambisonic_receiver = AmbisonicReceiver("AmbiMic", [1, 2, 1.5], radius=0.02)
room.add_receiver(ambisonic_receiver)

# ... run renderer ...
# output_audio will be a 4-channel numpy array
```

### Complex Geometry

See `examples/demo_polygon_room.py` for creating rooms from 2D floor plans.

## Acoustic Analysis & Visualization

RayRoom includes tools to analyze the acoustic properties of your simulated space from the generated Room Impulse Response (RIR). The renderer can return the RIR for each receiver if you set `record_paths=True` in the `render` method (note: this is renderer-dependent).

```python
from rayroom.analytics.acoustics import calculate_clarity, calculate_drr
from rayroom.room.visualize import plot_reverberation_time, plot_decay_curve

# Assuming 'rirs' is the dictionary of impulse responses from renderer.render()
rir = rirs[receiver.name]
fs = 44100

# 1. Calculate metrics
c80 = calculate_clarity(rir, fs, 80)  # Music clarity
drr = calculate_drr(rir, fs)
print(f"Music Clarity (C80): {c80:.2f} dB")
print(f"Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio: {drr:.2f} dB")

# 2. Plot reverberation time across frequency bands
plot_reverberation_time(rir, fs, filename="rt60.png", show=False)

# 3. Plot the decay curve for a specific frequency band
plot_decay_curve(rir, fs, band=1000, filename="decay_1000hz.png", show=False)
```

## Web Tools

RayRoom includes two visual web-based tools for designing rooms and creating simulation pipelines without writing code.

### 🏗️ Room Creator

Design acoustic rooms visually with a 2D/3D interface. Create custom geometries, place furniture, sources, and receivers, then export configurations for use in simulations.

```bash
python web/room_creator/launch_room_creator.py
```

### 🗺️ Blueprint Editor

Create complete audio simulation pipelines using a visual node-based editor. Connect nodes for rooms, renderers, effects, and metrics to build complex workflows.
