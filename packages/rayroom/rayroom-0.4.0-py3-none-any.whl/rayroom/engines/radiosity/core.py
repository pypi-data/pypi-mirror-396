"""
This module provides the core components for an acoustic radiosity simulation.

Acoustic Radiosity is an energy-based simulation method, well-suited for
modeling the late, diffuse reverberation in a room. It operates by:

  1.  Discretizing all surfaces in the room into a set of smaller "patches."
  2.  Calculating "view factors" (or form factors) that describe the geometric
      relationship and energy transfer potential between every pair of patches.
  3.  Solving a system of equations to determine how energy propagates and
      exchanges between these patches over time.

This implementation uses a time-dependent (or "transient") radiosity approach,
which allows it to generate a Room Impulse Response (RIR) directly. It is
often used in hybrid engines, where it complements methods like ISM or
ray tracing that handle the early specular reflections.

class RadiositySolver:
    """Acoustic Radiosity solver for late diffuse reverberation.

    This class divides room surfaces into patches and solves the energy
    exchange between them over time. It is designed to model the diffuse
    component of a room's acoustic response.

    Responsibilities:
      * Discretize the room's surfaces into a mesh of patches.
      * Compute the view factors between all pairs of patches.
      * Solve the time-dependent energy propagation.
      * Reconstruct the energy decay at a receiver's position.

            import rayroom as rt

            # Create a room with a source and receiver
            room = rt.room.ShoeBox([12, 10, 3.5])
