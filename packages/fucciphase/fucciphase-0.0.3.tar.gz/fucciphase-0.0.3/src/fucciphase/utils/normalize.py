    """Normalize channels, add in place the resulting columns to the
    dataframe, and return the new columns' name.

    A moving average can be applied to each individual track before normalization.

    Normalization is performed by inferring the min at the position of the maximum
    of the other channel. Then, the min is subtracted and the result is divided
    by (max - min).
    These values are computed across all spots in each channel. Note that the resulting
    normalized values are rounded to the 2nd decimal.

    The min and max values can be provided manually. They should be determined by
    imaging a large number of cells statically and computing the min and max values
    observed.
    This option is meant for static imaging. It is assumed that there are enough cells
    in the image to have enough samples from each phase of the cell cycle.

    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe
    channels : Union[str, List[str]]
        Name of the channels to normalize.

    moving_average_window : int
        Size of the window used for the moving average, default 7.
    manual_min : Optional[List[float]]
        If provided, the minimum value to use for normalization.
    manual_max : Optional[List[float]]
        If provided, the maximum value to use for normalization.
    track_id_name: str
