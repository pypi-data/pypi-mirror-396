**earthkit-workflows** is a Python library for declaring earthkit task as DAGs.
It contains an internal `cascade` engine for scheduling and executing task graphs almost optimally across heterogeneous platforms with complex network technologies and topologies.
It effectively performs task-based parallelism across CPUs, GPUs, distributed systems (HPC), and any combination thereof.
It is designed for a no-IO approach, where expensive storage of intermediate data is minimised whilst maximising all available transport technologies between different hardware.

Cascade is designed to work on well-profiled task graphs, where:
* the task graph is a static DAG,
* the DAG nodes are defined by tasks with well-known execution times,
* the DAG edges are defined by data dependencies with well-known data sizes,
* the characteristics of the hardware (processors, network connections) are known.

earthkit-workflows allows for declaring such task graphs using a neat fluent API, and interoperates pleasantly with the rest of the [earthkit](https://github.com/ecmwf/earthkit) ecosystem.

## Installation

Install via `pip` with:

```
$ pip install 'earthkit-workflows[all]'
```

For development, you can use `pip install -e .` though there is currently an issue with earthkit masking. Additionally you may want to install pre-commit hooks via
```
$ pip install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

## Quick Start

*Note*: this section is moderately outdated.

We support two regimes for cascade executions -- local mode (ideal for developing and debugging small graphs) and distributed mode (assumed for slurm & HPC).

To launch in local mode, in your python repl / jupyno:
```
import cascade.benchmarks.job1 as j1
import cascade.benchmarks.distributed as di
import cloudpickle

spec = di.ZmqClusterSpec.local(j1.get_prob())
print(spec.controller.outputs)
# prints out:
# {DatasetId(task='mean:dc9d90 ...
# defaults to all "sinks", but can be overridden

rv = di.launch_from_specs(spec, None)

for key, value in rv.outputs.items():
    deser = cloudpickle.loads(value)
    print(f"output {key} is of type {type(deser)}")
```

For distributed mode, launch
```
./scripts/launch_slurm.sh ./localConfigs/<your_config.sh>
```
Inside the `<your_config.sh>`, you define size of the cluster, logging directory output, which job to run... Pay special attention to definitions of your `venv` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` etc -- this is not autotamed.

Both of these examples hardcode particular job, `"job1"`, which is a benchmarking thing.
Most likely, you want to define your own -- for the local mode, just pass `cascade.Graph` instance to the call; in the dist mode, you need to provide that instance in the `cascade.benchmarks.__main__` modules instead (ideally by extending the `get_job` function).

There is also `python -m cascade.benchmarks local <..>` -- you may use that as an alternative path to local mode, for your own e2e tests.
