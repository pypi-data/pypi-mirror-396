## Contribution Notes

ATHF is a framework to internalize, not a platform to extend. However, if you've adapted ATHF in interesting ways or have feedback, we'd love to hear about it in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Nebulock-Inc/agentic-threat-hunting-framework/discussions).

For more on the philosophy, see [../USING_ATHF.md](../USING_ATHF.md).
