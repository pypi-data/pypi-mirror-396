"""
Storage module - Pluggable storage interface.

STT is a transmission protocol - it doesn't require storage.
Applications that need persistence implement the StorageProvider interface.

The StorageProvider protocol allows applications to plug in their own storage:
- ST Syndicate (Seigr's storage layer)
- Custom database backends
- Cloud storage adapters
- In-memory caches

BinaryStorage is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version.
Use StorageProvider interface instead.
