    This is the single entry point for all backup label generation. It handles both
    custom names and auto-generated date-based labels, ensuring uniqueness by checking
    the ops.backup_history table.

    Args:
        db: Database connection
        backup_type: Type of backup (incremental, full)
        database_name: Name of the database being backed up
        custom_name: Optional custom name for the backup. If provided, this becomes
                    the base label. If None, generates a date-based label.
