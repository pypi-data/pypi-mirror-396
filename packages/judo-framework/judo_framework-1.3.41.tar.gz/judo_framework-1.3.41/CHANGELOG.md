## [1.3.41] - 2024-12-14

### 🐛 BUG FIX - Mixed Mode Step Registration

**Critical fix for Mixed Mode step definitions not being recognized by Behave**

#### Problem
- Spanish steps with "que" prefix (e.g., `que agrego el header`) were not working with English keywords
- When using `Given agrego el header...`, Behave couldn't find the step (marked as skipped)
- The `@step()` decorator was registering steps with the exact text including "que"

#### Solution
- Added duplicate `@step()` decorators without "que" prefix for all Spanish steps
- Now both versions work: `Dado que agrego el header` AND `Given agrego el header`
- Added auto-registration mechanism to `steps_es.py` (similar to `steps.py`)
- Improved `__init__.py` to force reload of both English and Spanish steps

#### Impact
- ✅ Mixed Mode now works correctly
- ✅ Spanish steps work with both Spanish and English keywords
- ✅ No breaking changes - all existing tests continue to work
- ✅ Better step discovery and registration

## [1.3.40] - 2024-12-14

### 📚 DOCUMENTATION - Mixed Mode (Modo Mixto)

**Official documentation for writing tests with English keywords and Spanish descriptions!**

#### ✨ What's New
- **Mixed Mode Documentation**: Complete guide on using `Given/When/Then` keywords with Spanish step descriptions
- **Natural for LATAM**: Reflects how Latin American developers actually write code
- **Already Available**: Spanish steps have always used `@step()`, making them work with any keyword
- **Zero Configuration**: Works automatically, no setup needed
- **Examples Added**: New example files demonstrating mixed mode usage

#### 📝 Example

**Spanish mode (with language tag):**
```gherkin
# language: es
Dado que tengo un cliente Judo API
Cuando hago una petición GET a "/users"
Entonces el código de respuesta debe ser 200
```

**Mixed mode (no language tag needed):**
```gherkin
Given tengo un cliente Judo API
When hago una petición GET a "/users"
Then el código de respuesta debe ser 200
```

**How it works:** Spanish steps use `@step()` decorator, which accepts any keyword (Given/When/Then/And/But).

#### 🎯 Benefits
- **More Natural**: Shorter English keywords, clear Spanish descriptions
- **Better Readability**: Easier to scan and understand test scenarios
- **Team Friendly**: Perfect for bilingual teams in Latin America
- **Flexible**: Mix with pure English or Spanish steps as needed
- **No Extra Code**: Uses existing Spanish steps with `@step()` decorator

#### 📚 Documentation
- New file: `examples/mixed_mode_example.feature` - Working example
- New guide: `examples/README_mixed_mode.md` - Complete documentation
- Updated: `examples/README.md` - Added mixed mode reference

### 🔧 BREAKING CHANGE - Playwright Steps Removed

**Playwright integration now provides infrastructure only, not pre-built steps**

#### What Changed
- ❌ Removed `judo/playwright/steps.py`
- ❌ Removed `judo/playwright/steps_es.py`
- ✅ Kept `JudoBrowserContext` and all browser automation infrastructure
- ✅ Users create their own custom Playwright steps based on their needs

#### Why This Change?
- **More Flexible**: Every project has different UI testing needs
- **Less Opinionated**: Users define their own step patterns
- **Cleaner Separation**: Judo provides API steps, users provide UI steps
- **Better Maintenance**: No need to maintain 50+ browser steps

#### Migration Guide
If you were using pre-built Playwright steps, create your own in `features/steps/`:

```python
from behave import given, when, then

@when('navego a "{url}"')
def step_navigate(context, url):
    context.judo_context.navigate_to(url)

@when('hago clic en "{selector}"')
def step_click(context, selector):
    context.judo_context.click_element(selector)

@then('el elemento "{selector}" debe ser visible')
def step_visible(context, selector):
    assert context.judo_context.is_element_visible(selector)
```

All `JudoBrowserContext` methods remain available and unchanged.

- CSS styling for screenshot display with hover effects
- JavaScript for fullscreen screenshot viewing

#### 📝 Usage Examples

**Automatic (on failure):**
```python
# In environment.py
os.environ['JUDO_SCREENSHOT_ON_STEP_FAILURE'] = 'true'
```

**Manual (in steps):**
```python
@when('I take a screenshot')
def step_impl(context):
    context.judo_context.take_screenshot("my_screenshot")
    # Automatically attached to HTML report!
```

**After every step:**
```python
# In environment.py
os.environ['JUDO_SCREENSHOT_AFTER_STEP'] = 'true'
```

#### 🎯 Benefits
- **Better Debugging**: Visual evidence of test failures
- **Self-Contained Reports**: No need to manage separate screenshot files
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean, integrated screenshot display
- **Easy Sharing**: Single HTML file contains everything

## [1.3.36] - 2024-12-13

### 🚀 New Feature - Single Report for Multiple Features
- **NEW**: Added `run_all_features_together` parameter to BaseRunner (default: True)
- **FIXED**: Multiple features now generate a single HTML report instead of overwriting each other
- **Benefit**: See all your test results in one consolidated report

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Added `run_all_features_together` parameter to `BaseRunner.__init__()`
- New method `run_all_features_in_one_execution()` executes all features in a single behave call
- When enabled, all features are passed to behave at once, generating one unified report
- When disabled (or when using parallel execution), behaves like before (one feature at a time)

### 💡 Usage

**Default behavior (single report):**
```python
runner = BaseRunner(
    features_dir="features",
    output_dir="judo_reports"
    # run_all_features_together=True by default
)
results = runner.run(tags=["@smoke"])
# ✅ Generates ONE report with all features
```

**Old behavior (separate reports):**
```python
runner = BaseRunner(
    features_dir="features",
    output_dir="judo_reports",
    run_all_features_together=False  # Execute features separately
)
results = runner.run(tags=["@smoke"])
# Each feature generates its own report (last one wins)
```

### ✅ Benefits
- ✅ Single consolidated HTML report with all features
- ✅ Works with mixed language features (English + Spanish)
- ✅ No more overwritten reports
- ✅ Better overview of all test results
- ✅ Backward compatible (can disable if needed)

### 📝 Notes
- Parallel execution (`parallel=True`) still runs features separately (required for parallelism)
- The new behavior is the default for better user experience
- Set `run_all_features_together=False` to get the old behavior

## [1.3.35] - 2024-12-13

### 🚀 New Feature - Environment Variables Support (.env)
- **NEW**: Added support for loading headers from environment variables and .env files
- **Dependency**: Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` to dependencies
- **Use Case**: Perfect for API keys, tokens, and sensitive data that shouldn't be in code

### 📝 New Steps Available

#### English Steps
```gherkin
Given I set the header "Authorization" from env "API_TOKEN"
Given I set the header "X-API-Key" from env "MY_API_KEY"
```

#### Spanish Steps
```gherkin
Dado que establezco el header "Authorization" desde env "API_TOKEN"
Dado que agrego el header "X-API-Key" desde env "MI_API_KEY"
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Added `set_header_from_env()` method to `JudoContext`
- Automatically loads `.env` file if `python-dotenv` is installed
- Falls back to system environment variables if `.env` not found
- Clear error message if environment variable doesn't exist

### 💡 Usage Example

**Create a .env file:**
```env
API_TOKEN=Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
API_KEY=sk_test_1234567890abcdef
BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

**Use in your feature files:**
```gherkin
# language: es
Característica: API con autenticación desde .env

  Escenario: Consultar API con token desde .env
    Dado que tengo un cliente Judo API
    Y que la URL base es "https://api.example.com"
    Y que agrego el header "Authorization" desde env "API_TOKEN"
    Y que agrego el header "X-API-Key" desde env "API_KEY"
    Cuando hago una petición GET a "/users"
    Entonces el código de respuesta debe ser 200
```

### ✅ Benefits
- ✅ Keep sensitive data out of version control
- ✅ Easy configuration per environment (dev, staging, prod)
- ✅ Works with both .env files and system environment variables
- ✅ Clear error messages when variables are missing
- ✅ Available in both English and Spanish

## [1.3.34] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Response Time Validation in Spanish
- **FIXED**: Spanish step for response time validation now works correctly
- **Issue**: Step used `response.elapsed_time` which doesn't exist
- **Correct**: Changed to `response.elapsed` (property that exists in JudoResponse)

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Fixed `step_validate_response_time_es` in `steps_es.py`
- Changed from `elapsed_time` to `elapsed`
- Improved error message to show time in 3 decimal places
- English step was already correct

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ Spanish step now executes correctly (no longer pending/undefined)
- ✅ Shows proper timing validation
- ✅ Better error messages with formatted time

### 📝 Example Usage
```gherkin
# Español (ahora funciona!)
Cuando hago una petición GET a "/users/1"
Entonces el código de respuesta debe ser 200
Y el tiempo de respuesta debe ser menor a 5.0 segundos

# English (always worked)
When I send a GET request to "/users/1"
Then the response status should be 200
And the response time should be less than 5.0 seconds
```

## [1.3.33] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Array Validation for Root-Level Arrays
- **FIXED**: Array validation steps now work with root-level arrays (when response is directly an array)
- **Issue**: Steps failed when response was `[{...}, {...}]` instead of `{"users": [{...}, {...}]}`
- **Error**: `AssertionError: No se puede navegar a 'users' - ruta inválida`

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Modified `step_validate_nested_array_contains_item` (English)
- Modified `step_validate_nested_array_contains_item_es` (Spanish)
- Added check: if `response.json` is already a list, use it directly
- Only navigate through object properties if response is a dict

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ Works with root-level arrays: `GET /users` → `[{id: 1, ...}, {id: 2, ...}]`
- ✅ Works with nested arrays: `GET /data` → `{"users": [{id: 1, ...}]}`
- ✅ Better error messages when path not found
- ✅ Both English and Spanish steps fixed

### 📝 Example Usage
```gherkin
# Root-level array (now works!)
When I send a GET request to "/users"
Then the response array "users" should contain an item with "id" equal to "1"

# Nested array (still works)
When I send a GET request to "/data"
Then the response array "data.users" should contain an item with "id" equal to "1"
```

## [1.3.32] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Steps Not Executing & Request/Response Data
- **FIXED**: Steps now execute correctly and show proper timing/status
- **FIXED**: Request/response data now appears in HTML reports
- **Root Cause**: Previous fix (v1.3.31) blocked auto_hooks completely, preventing step execution
- **Solution**: Removed formatter from BaseRunner, let auto_hooks handle everything

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Auto_hooks now always capture data (no conditional blocking)
- Removed JudoFormatter from BaseRunner command
- Auto_hooks capture request/response data during step execution
- HTML report generated by after_all_judo hook with all captured data
- Steps execute normally with proper before/after hooks

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ Steps execute and show correct timing (not 0.000s)
- ✅ Steps show correct status icons (✅ ❌ ⏭️)
- ✅ Request/response data captured during execution
- ✅ HTML reports include all HTTP details
- ✅ No duplicates (only auto_hooks capture data)
- ✅ Works with both BaseRunner and direct behave execution

### 📝 How It Works Now
1. User runs tests with BaseRunner
2. BaseRunner executes behave with auto_hooks
3. Auto_hooks call before_step_judo → reporter.start_step()
4. Step executes → make_request() captures HTTP data → adds to reporter.current_step
5. Auto_hooks call after_step_judo → reporter.finish_step()
6. After all tests → after_all_judo generates HTML with all captured data

## [1.3.31] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Duplicate Features/Scenarios in Reports
- **FIXED**: Eliminated duplicate features and scenarios in HTML reports when using BaseRunner
- **Root Cause**: Both JudoFormatter and auto_hooks were capturing the same data simultaneously
- **Solution**: Auto_hooks now detect when BaseRunner is active and skip report capture

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Auto_hooks check for `JUDO_REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable
- When BaseRunner is active (env var present), auto_hooks only handle Judo context
- JudoFormatter handles all report capture when BaseRunner is used
- Auto_hooks still work normally when running behave directly (without BaseRunner)

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ No more duplicate features in HTML reports
- ✅ No more duplicate scenarios in HTML reports
- ✅ Clean, single report with correct data
- ✅ Request/response data still captured correctly
- ✅ Both BaseRunner and direct behave execution work correctly

## [1.3.30] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Request/Response Data in HTML Reports with BaseRunner
- **FIXED**: HTML reports now correctly display request/response data when using BaseRunner
- **Root Cause**: BaseRunner was executing behave in subprocess without proper formatter configuration
- **Solution**: Added JudoFormatter to behave command and configured output directory via environment variable

### 🔧 Technical Details
- BaseRunner now adds `--format judo.behave.formatter:JudoFormatter` to behave command
- Output directory passed via `JUDO_REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable
- JudoFormatter captures request/response data during execution in subprocess
- HTML report generated by formatter includes all captured HTTP data
- Removed duplicate report generation logic from BaseRunner

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ Request/response data now appears in HTML reports when using BaseRunner
- ✅ Both English and Spanish features show complete HTTP details
- ✅ Debug logs confirm data capture: `[DEBUG] Request/Response data added to step`
- ✅ HTML reports generated in correct output directory
- ✅ No more duplicate or missing reports

### 📝 How It Works
1. BaseRunner sets `JUDO_REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable
2. BaseRunner adds JudoFormatter to behave command
3. Behave subprocess runs with JudoFormatter active
4. JudoFormatter captures all request/response data during execution
5. JudoFormatter generates HTML report at end of execution
6. HTML report includes all captured HTTP data

## [1.3.29] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Hotfix - Syntax Error
- **FIXED**: Corrected syntax error in `base_runner.py` line 337
- **Issue**: Missing comma after `env=os.environ` parameter in subprocess.run()
- **Impact**: Version 1.3.28 had a syntax error that prevented import
- **Solution**: Added missing comma to fix Python syntax

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ BaseRunner now imports without syntax errors
- ✅ Environment variables properly passed to behave subprocess
- ✅ All functionality from v1.3.28 now working correctly

## [1.3.28] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - BaseRunner Environment Variables
- **FIXED**: BaseRunner now correctly passes environment variables to behave subprocess
- **Root Cause**: `subprocess.run()` was not passing `env=os.environ`, causing environment variables like `JUDO_DEBUG_REPORTER` to not be inherited
- **Impact**: This was preventing the reporter integration code from working when using BaseRunner
- **Solution**: Added `env=os.environ` to all `subprocess.run()` calls in BaseRunner

### ✅ What's Fixed
- ✅ Environment variables now properly passed to behave subprocess
- ✅ `JUDO_DEBUG_REPORTER=true` now works with BaseRunner
- ✅ Request/response data now captured correctly when using BaseRunner
- ✅ Both direct behave execution and BaseRunner now work identically

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Modified `run_behave_command()` in `base_runner.py`
- Added `env=os.environ` parameter to both verbose and non-verbose subprocess calls
- Ensures all environment variables are inherited by the behave subprocess

## [1.3.27] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Request/Response Data in HTML Reports
- **FIXED**: HTML reports now correctly display request/response data for ALL tests
- **Root Cause**: Version 1.3.26 published to PyPI was missing the complete reporter integration code
- **Solution**: Ensured all request/response capture code is included in the published package
- **Verified**: Both English and Spanish features now show complete HTTP data in reports

### ✅ What's Working Now
- ✅ Request details (method, URL, headers, body) appear in HTML reports
- ✅ Response details (status, headers, body, timing) appear in HTML reports
- ✅ Works for both English and Spanish feature files
- ✅ Works for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- ✅ Debug mode available with `JUDO_DEBUG_REPORTER=true` environment variable

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Fixed `JudoContext.make_request()` integration with HTML reporter
- Ensured `reporter.current_step` is properly populated during request execution
- Added proper error handling for reporter integration failures
- Cleaned up debug logging (now only enabled with env var)

## [1.3.26] - 2024-12-12

### ✅ Verified & Production Ready - Spanish HTML Reports
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive testing confirms Spanish HTML reports work correctly
- **Request/Response Data**: All HTTP data captured and displayed properly in Spanish features
- **Both Languages Verified**: English and Spanish features show identical functionality

- ✅ Both simple and complex scenarios capture HTTP data properly

## [1.3.24] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Spanish HTML Report Integration (FINAL)
- **Root Cause Identified**: `_get_or_create_reporter()` in auto_hooks was creating different reporter instances
- **Problem**: Spanish steps used different reporter than request/response data capture system
- **Solution**: Modified `_get_or_create_reporter()` to reuse existing global reporter instead of creating new one
- **Result**: Spanish and English steps now use same reporter instance for consistent data capture

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Fixed reporter instance inconsistency in `judo/behave/auto_hooks.py`
- Added Unicode encoding safety for Windows compatibility in hooks and context
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with `JUDO_DEBUG_REPORTER` environment variable
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing implementations

### ✅ Verified Resolution
- Spanish HTML reports now display complete request/response data identical to English
- Both JSON file logging and HTML report integration work correctly in Spanish
- All Unicode encoding issues resolved for Windows environments
- Comprehensive testing confirms parity between English and Spanish functionality

## [1.3.23] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Spanish HTML Report Integration
- **Fixed Request/Response Display**: Spanish steps now properly display request/response data in HTML reports

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Step Pattern Matching Order
- **Fixed Step Precedence**: Moved variable-based request step before specific method steps to fix pattern matching
- **Root Cause**: Behave was matching `I send a POST request to "{endpoint}" with JSON` instead of the variable step
- **Solution**: Reordered step definitions so variable patterns are matched first
- **Fixed URL Encoding**: No more malformed URLs like `posts%22%20with%20the%20variable%20%22newPost`
- **Pattern Matching**: Variable steps now have higher priority than specific method steps

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Moved `@step('I send a {method} request to "{endpoint}" with the variable "{var_name}"')` to the top
- Added comment explaining the importance of step order
- Behave matches steps in definition order, so more specific patterns must come first
- No breaking changes - all existing syntax continues to work

### 📝 Now Working Correctly
```gherkin
When I send a POST request to "/posts" with the variable "newPost"
# ✅ Now correctly matches the variable step, not the JSON step
# ✅ URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts (correct)
# ❌ Was: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts%22%20with%20the%20variable%20%22newPost
```

## [1.3.12] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Variable Request Step Implementation
- **Fixed Missing Step**: The step `I send a {method} request to "{endpoint}" with the variable "{var_name}"` was not properly interpolating endpoints
- **Root Cause**: Step definition existed but was missing endpoint interpolation, causing malformed URLs in request logging
- **Solution**: Added `endpoint = context.judo_context.interpolate_string(endpoint)` to the step definition
- **Fixed URL Generation**: Now correctly processes `/posts/{userId}` instead of malformed URLs
- **Showcase Files**: Fixed showcase examples that were using this step

### 🔧 Technical Details

### 📝 Working Syntax
```gherkin
Given I set the variable "newPost" to the JSON
  """
  {"title": "Test", "body": "Content", "userId": 1}
  """
When I send a POST request to "/posts" with the variable "newPost"
# ✅ Now correctly sends to: /posts (not malformed URL)
```

## [1.3.11] - 2024-12-12

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Variable Interpolation in Request Steps
- **Fixed Variable Steps**: Fixed `I send a {method} request to "{endpoint}" with the variable "{var_name}"` step not interpolating endpoint variables

## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

No breaking changes. Spanish steps are automatically available.

**To use Spanish:**
```gherkin
# language: es
Característica: Mi Feature

  Escenario: Mi Escenario
    Dado que la URL base es "https://api.example.com"
    Cuando hago una petición GET a "/users"
    Entonces el código de respuesta debe ser 200
```

### From 1.1.x to 1.2.0

**Old way (1.1.x):**
```python
# environment.py - 100+ lines with manual hooks
from judo.behave import setup_judo_context
from judo.reporting.reporter import get_reporter
# ... many more lines
```

**New way (1.2.0+):**
```python
# environment.py - Just 10 lines!
from judo.behave import *

before_all = before_all_judo
before_feature = before_feature_judo
after_feature = after_feature_judo
before_scenario = before_scenario_judo
after_scenario = after_scenario_judo
before_step = before_step_judo
after_step = after_step_judo
after_all = after_all_judo
```

### From 1.0.x to 1.1.x

Update your environment.py to use the new simplified setup.
