Feature: Judo Framework Complete Showcase
  This feature demonstrates all capabilities of Judo Framework
  Each scenario showcases a specific feature or step type

  Background:
    Given I have a Judo API client
    And the base URL is "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"

  # ============================================
  # BASIC HTTP METHODS
  # ============================================

  @http @get
  Scenario: GET request - Retrieve a resource
    # GET is used to retrieve/read data from the server
    # It should NOT modify any data
    # Status 200 means success
    When I send a GET request to "/users/1"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should contain "id"
    And the response should contain "name"
    And the response should contain "email"

  @http @post
  Scenario: POST request - Create a new resource
    # POST is used to CREATE new resources on the server
    # Send data in JSON format in the request body
    # Status 201 means "Created" - resource was successfully created
    # The response usually includes the new resource with its generated ID
    When I send a POST request to "/posts" with JSON
      """
      {
        "title": "Judo Framework Test",
        "body": "Testing POST request",
        "userId": 1
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 201
    And the response should contain "id"
    And the response field "title" should equal "Judo Framework Test"

  @http @put
  Scenario: PUT request - Update entire resource
    # PUT is used to REPLACE/UPDATE an entire resource
    # You must send ALL fields, even if only changing one
    # Missing fields may be set to null or default values
    # Status 200 means the update was successful
    When I send a PUT request to "/posts/1" with JSON
      """
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Updated Title",
        "body": "Updated Body",
        "userId": 1
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response field "title" should equal "Updated Title"

  @http @patch
  Scenario: PATCH request - Partial update
    # PATCH is used for PARTIAL updates
    # Only send the fields you want to change
    # Other fields remain unchanged
    # More efficient than PUT when updating few fields
    When I send a PATCH request to "/posts/1" with JSON
      """
      {
        "title": "Patched Title"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response field "title" should equal "Patched Title"

  @http @delete
  Scenario: DELETE request - Remove a resource
    # DELETE is used to remove/delete a resource
    # Usually returns 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content)
    # After deletion, GET requests to the same resource should return 404
    When I send a DELETE request to "/posts/1"
    Then the response status should be 200

  # ============================================
  # QUERY PARAMETERS
  # ============================================

  @query-params
  Scenario: Query parameters - Filter results with string value
    # This filters posts to only show posts from userId=1
    # URL will be: /posts?userId=1
    Given I set the query parameter "userId" to "1"
    When I send a GET request to "/posts"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should be an array
    And each item in the response array should have "userId"

  @query-params
  Scenario: Query parameters - Limit results with numeric value
    # This limits the response to only 5 items
    # URL will be: /posts?_limit=5
    Given I set the query parameter "_limit" to 5
    When I send a GET request to "/posts"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response array should have 5 items

  @query-params
  Scenario: Query parameters - Multiple parameters combined
    # Combine multiple query parameters
    # URL will be: /posts?userId=1&_limit=3

    And the response should be an array
    And the response array should have 3 items

  # ============================================
  # HEADERS

      """
      {
        "title": "Variable Test",
        "body": "Testing JSON variable",

    # Extract specific fields from responses to use in later steps
    # Common use case: Create a resource, extract its ID, then use that ID
    # This enables testing complete workflows
    When I send a POST request to "/posts" with JSON
      """
      {
        "title": "Extract Test",
        "body": "Testing extraction",
        "userId": 1
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 201
    # Extract the "id" field and store it as "createdPostId" variable
    And I extract "$.id" from the response as "createdPostId"
    # Now use the extracted ID to fetch the created post
    When I send a GET request to "/posts/{createdPostId}"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response field "title" should equal "Extract Test"
