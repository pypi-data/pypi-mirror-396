![sample_product](assets/subset_los_angeles_fire_2025_03_03.png)

Welcome! This site documents the DIST-S1 package. The documentation is focused two important aspects of the `DIST-S1` package:

1. The available parameters and their description exposed via `RunConfigData` and `AlgoConfigData` (see [Config Overview](pages/config/overview.md)). This is related to the `run_sas` entrypoint relevant for Hybrid Science Data System (HySDS) usage.
2. The product structure of the `DIST-S1` product (see [Product Overview](pages/product_documentation/product_documentation.md)) 

For complete set of entrypoints of `DIST-S1`, please see the DIST-S1 [Readme.md](https://github.com/opera-adt/dist-s1/blob/dev/README.md) and examples on the repository.
