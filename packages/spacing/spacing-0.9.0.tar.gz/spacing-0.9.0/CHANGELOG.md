- **Complete automation**: Just bump version in `pyproject.toml` and push to main - tagging and publishing happen automatically
- See `PYPI_SETUP.md` for setup instructions

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-10

**NEW FEATURE: Smart Path Discovery with Exclusions**

- **Automatic file discovery**: Running `spacing` without arguments now automatically discovers and formats all `.py` files in the current directory (recursively)
- **Smart default exclusions**: Automatically excludes common directories that shouldn't be formatted:
  - All hidden directories (starting with `.`)
  - Virtual environments: `venv`, `env`, `virtualenv`
  - Build artifacts: `build`, `dist`, `__pycache__`, `*.egg-info`, `*.egg`
- **Configurable exclusions**: New `[paths]` section in `spacing.toml` allows custom exclusions:
  - `exclude_names`: List of directory/file names to exclude
  - `exclude_patterns`: List of glob patterns to exclude
  - `include_hidden`: Override default hidden directory exclusion
- **Explicit path override**: Exclusions only apply during automatic discovery; explicitly provided paths bypass all exclusions
- **New module**: Added `pathfilter.py` for path discovery and filtering logic

## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-10
