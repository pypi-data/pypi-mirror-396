   garbage.

   The authors provide NO GUARANTEE that this software will:
   - Work correctly in all situations
   - Protect your data from all threats
   - Be free of bugs or security vulnerabilities
   - Be compatible with future systems or GPG versions

4. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR:
   - Lost, corrupted, or inaccessible data
   - Security breaches due to weak keys or poor practices
   - Damages arising from software bugs or misuse
   - Your failure to maintain proper key backups

5. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR:
   - Maintaining secure backups of your GPG keys
   - Using strong passphrases
   - Understanding how GPG encryption works

If you cannot accept these terms, DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE.

You have been warned.
