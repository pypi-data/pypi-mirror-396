# scai

**scai (Scaffold AI)** is a developer tool that instantly turns AI-generated directory tree text into actual files and folders.

Stop manually creating folders. Just copy the tree from ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, or other LLMs, paste it into scai, and build your project structure instantly.

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install scai-tool
```

## Usage

### 1. GUI Mode (Recommended)

Launch the visual interface:

```bash
scai
```

Steps:

- Paste your directory tree structure into the left input box
- Click **Preview** to verify the generated paths
- Click **Generate** to create the files and folders

### 2. CLI Mode

You can also use scai directly from the command line.

Pipe input into scai:

```bash
cat tree.txt | scai
```

Read from a file:

```bash
scai tree.txt
```
