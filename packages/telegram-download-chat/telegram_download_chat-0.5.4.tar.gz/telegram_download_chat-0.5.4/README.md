The form remembers your last values using the same `config.yml` as the
GUI under `form_settings` so you don't need to retype them each time.

1. Install with web dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install "telegram-download-chat[web]"
   ```

2. Launch the web UI:
   ```bash
   telegram-download-chat-web

## Advanced Features

### Extract Messages from Telegram Archive

You can extract messages from a Telegram export archive (`result.json`) that you've downloaded from Telegram Desktop:

```bash
# Extract all messages from all chats
telegram-download-chat "/path/to/Telegram Desktop/DataExport/result.json"

# Extract only messages from a specific user (by their Telegram ID)
telegram-download-chat "/path/to/Telegram Desktop/DataExport/result.json" --user 123456

# Save to a custom output file
telegram-download-chat "/path/to/Telegram Desktop/DataExport/result.json" -o my_exported_chats.json
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Processing your full Telegram data export
- Extracting specific conversations from the export
- Converting the export to a more readable format
- Filtering messages by user or date range (using `--until` or `--last-days`)

The tool will process the archive and generate both JSON and TXT files with the exported messages.

### Resuming Interrupted Downloads
If the download is interrupted, you can simply run the same command again to resume from where it left off. The tool automatically saves progress to a temporary file.
You can also resume later using `--since-id` with the last downloaded message ID or let the tool read it from the existing JSON file.

### User Mapping
Display names for users and bots are collected automatically. You can override them in the `users_map` section:

```yaml
users_map:
  123456: "Alice Smith"
  789012: "Bob Johnson"
```

### Chat Mapping
Titles for group and channel chats are fetched automatically. Use `chats_map` only if you want to override them:

```yaml
chats_map:
  100123456: "MyGroup"
```

### Subchat Extraction
Extract conversations from specific threads or reply chains:

```bash
# Extract messages from a specific thread
telegram-download-chat group_username --subchat 12345 --subchat-name "Important Discussion"

# Or use a direct message URL
telegram-download-chat group_username --subchat "https://t.me/c/123456789/12345"
```

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

For users who prefer a visual interface, the application includes an optional GUI that provides an intuitive way to download Telegram chats.

### Launching the GUI

```bash
# Launch the GUI application
telegram-download-chat --gui
```

### GUI Features

The GUI provides all the functionality of the command-line interface with additional user-friendly features:

#### Main Interface
- **Chat Input**: Enter chat identifier (username, phone number, chat ID, or URL)
- **Output Directory**: Select where to save downloaded files
- **Download Options**: Configure limit, date filters, and other parameters
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar showing download status
- **File List**: View all downloaded files with easy access

#### Advanced Options
- **Message Limit**: Set maximum number of messages to download
- **Date Filter**: Download messages only until a specific date
- **User Filter**: Filter messages by specific sender
- **Subchat Extraction**: Extract messages from specific threads
- **Split Output**: Save messages into separate files by month or year
- **Debug Mode**: Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting

#### Smart Download Management
- **Pause/Resume**: Stop and resume downloads at any time
- **Message Saving**: When you stop a download, all messages that were already fetched are automatically saved
- **Progress Persistence**: Downloads can be resumed from where they left off
- **File Organization**: Downloaded files are automatically organized and displayed

#### Stop and Save Functionality
One of the key GUI features is the ability to stop downloads while preserving progress:

1. **During Download**: Click the "Stop" button to halt the current download
2. **Automatic Saving**: The application will save all messages that were already downloaded
3. **User Feedback**: You'll see a message like "Stopping download and saving messages..."
4. **File Collection**: After stopping, the GUI will display "Messages saved successfully! Found X file(s)."
5. **File Access**: All saved files are immediately available in the file list

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Large chats where you want to preview initial messages
- Testing downloads before committing to full extraction
- Situations where you need to stop due to time constraints
- Recovering partial downloads when issues occur

### GUI vs Command Line

| Feature | GUI | Command Line |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Ease of use | Intuitive interface | Requires command knowledge |
| Progress tracking | Visual progress bar | Text-based progress |
| File management | Integrated file browser | Manual file navigation |
| Stop/Resume | One-click stop with auto-save | Manual interruption |
| Configuration | Visual forms | Manual config editing |
| Batch operations | One chat at a time | Scriptable |
| Automation | Interactive only | Fully scriptable |

## Streamlit Web Interface

In addition to the desktop GUI, a basic web interface built with
Streamlit is available for quick access from the browser. The web UI
provides controls for all CLI arguments, displays download progress,
allows you to stop a running download, and lets you download the resulting TXT
file with a small preview.

```bash
telegram-download-chat-web
```

The web interface provides a simple form to input chat identifiers and
download a limited number of messages. It saves your previous values in
the same `config.yml` under `form_settings` so you can easily tweak
options. The selected preset is stored there as well. Presets from the config can be selected in a dropdown. Selecting a preset immediately fills the form with its values. Use
"Save as preset" to store the current form values (existing presets with
the same name are replaced), update the chosen preset when the form
differs using the **Update preset** button, or delete it via the trash
icon.

## Output Formats

The tool generates the following files for each chat:

### JSON Output (`[chat_name].json`)
Contains complete message data including metadata like:
- Message IDs and timestamps
- Sender information
- Message content (including formatting)
- Reply information
- Media and file attachments
- Reactions and views

### Text Output (`[chat_name].txt`)
A human-readable version of the chat with:
- Formatted timestamps
- Display names from your `users_map`
- Message content with basic formatting
- Reply indicators

### Example Output Structure

```
2025-05-25 10:30:15 Alice -> MyGroup:
Hello everyone!

2025-05-25 10:31:22 Bob -> MyGroup (replying to Alice):
Hi Alice! How are you?

2025-05-25 10:32:45 Charlie -> MyGroup:
Welcome to the group!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Errors**
   - Ensure your API credentials are correct
   - Try disabling VPN if you're having connection issues
   - Check if your account is not restricted

2. **Missing Messages**
   - Some messages might be deleted or restricted
   - Check if you have the necessary permissions in the chat
   - Try with a smaller limit first

3. **Slow Downloads**
   - The tool respects Telegram's rate limits
   - Increase `request_delay` in config for more reliable downloads
   - Consider using a smaller `limit` parameter
4. **Progress bar**
   - progress show 1000 messages by default
   - when current > 1000, set max to 10000, then 50000, then 100000, etc.
5. **Session file locked on Windows**
   - Sometimes the `session.session` file cannot be deleted during logout
