# SiEPIC Forge

This python module implements the [SiEPIC EBeam
PDK](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) PDK as components and
technology specification for
[PhotonForge](https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/photonforge/)


## Installation

### Python interface

Installation via `pip`:

    pip install siepic-forge


## Usage

The simplest way to use the this PDK in PhotonForge is to set its technology as
default:

    import photonforge as pf
    import siepic_forge as siepic

    tech = siepic.ebeam()
    pf.config.default_technology = tech


The `ebeam` function creates a parametric technology and accepts a number of
parameters to fine-tune the technology.

PDK components are available through the `component` function, which takes a
component name as first argument. The list of component names is available as a
set `component_names`:

    print(siepic.component_names)
    
    pdk_component = siepic.component("ebeam_y_1550")


More information can be obtained in the documentation for each function:

    help(siepic.ebeam)

    help(siepic.component)


## Warnings

Please note that the 3D structures obtained by extrusion through this module's
technologies are a best approximation of the intended fabricated structures,
but the actual final dimensions may differ due to several fabrication-specific
effects. In particular, doping profiles are represented with hard-boundary,
homogeneous solids, but, in practice will present process-dependent variations
with smooth boundaries.
