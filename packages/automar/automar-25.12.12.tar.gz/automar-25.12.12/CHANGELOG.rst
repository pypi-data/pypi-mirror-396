Added
~~~~~

- Feature importance computation for autoregressive synthesis

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Improved Prediction tab UX

Fixed
~~~~~
- Logistic regression prediction threshold optimization and input shape handling
- GPU locking issues in logistic regression predictions
- CSV filename collision in visualization causing data overwrites

25.12.07 - 2025-12-07
------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- PCA visualization now displays feature correlation matrix instead of covariance matrix for improved interpretability. Diagonal values are always 1, and all values are normalized between -1 and 1.

------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Predictions now use the optimized threshold computed during training (via Youden's J statistic) instead of hardcoded 0.5. Applies to all model types and prediction modes.
