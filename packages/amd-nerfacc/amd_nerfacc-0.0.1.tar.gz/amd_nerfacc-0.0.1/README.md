# amd-nerfacc
NerfAcc is a PyTorch Nerf acceleration toolbox for both training and inference. It focus on efficient sampling in the volumetric rendering pipeline of radiance fields, which is universal and plug-and-play for most of the NeRFs. With minimal modifications to the existing codebases, Nerfacc provides significant speedups in training various recent NeRF papers. **And it is pure Python interface with flexible APIs!**
