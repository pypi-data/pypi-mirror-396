# cattle_hugs

cattle_hugs is an interaction management extension for
[cattle_grid](https://bovine.codeberg.page/cattle_grid/).
The goal of cattle_hugs is to provide some of the primitives
needed to interact with the rest of the Fediverse.

## Features

The two features of this extension are:

* Keep track of information used to display an actor, i.e. ObjectMetaInfo from muck_out
* Allow the tracking of interactions, e.g. replies and likes

There are some derived features such as providing API
endpoints to retrieve this data. However, the above two
features consider the goals of this extension.

We note that cattle_hugs is for public information.

### Methods

The methods to implement something should be exported from
`cattle_hugs` and the used pydantic models from `cattle_hugs.types`.

The information on this may change.

### Including in cattle_grid

Currently the cattle_grid extension has no configuration and can
be included by installing the package `cattle-hugs` and then adding

```toml
[[extensions]]
module = "cattle_hugs"
```

to your `extensions.toml` file.

## Development

### Running tests

One can run the tests via

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Running BDD Tests

First one needs to download the [fediverse-features](https://codeberg.org/helge/fediverse-features)
via

```bash
uv run python -mfediverse_features
```

This downloads

```
features/fediverse-features/
└── w3c
    ├── ap_likes.feature
    ├── ap_replies.feature
    └── ap_shares.feature
```

Then one can run the tests with

```bash
docker compose up --wait
docker compose run --name runner --rm cattle_grid_app ./test_shell.sh
behave
```
