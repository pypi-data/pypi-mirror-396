# Polaris - A New Product Development Case Study

This example shows sample path analysis applied to a new product development process.
The context for this analysis can be found in our post
[Little's Law in a Complex Adaptive System](https://www.polaris-flow-dispatch.com/i/172332418/the-polaris-case-study)

The specific scenario that we discussed in detail in that post can be found in the
[completed-stories-tukey](flow-of-work/complete-stories-outliers-removed) directory.

In addition to those scenarios, we also have the following scenarios

- The stability analysis for [the defects sub-process](flow-of-work/defects)
- The stability analysis for
  [all completed stories without outlier filtering](flow-of-work/complete-stories)
- The divergence of [aging work](flow-of-work/aging-stories-defects) showing the
  stablity impact of unbounded open work.
- The stabilization of [complete epics](flow-of-work/complete-epics)
- The divergence of [aging epics](flow-of-work/aging-epics)
