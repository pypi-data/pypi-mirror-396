# 🛡️ SaiSpec: The AI Governance & Logic Audit System

**SaiSpec** is a runtime governance framework for AI agents.  
It acts as a **flight recorder** and **safety interceptor** for LLM-based 
applications.

Unlike simple guardrails that only scan text, **SaiSpec enforces stateful 
governance protocols**:

- **RBAC (Authority):** Does the agent have the license to use this tool?
- **Accountability:** Did the agent justify its high-stakes decision?
- **Impact Control:** Is a human watching an irreversible action?
- **Audit Trails:** Is every override permanently logged?
