## ⚙️ Configuration Options (Optional)

These are **optional** - the defaults work great! But if you want more control:

### Detection Modes

Choose how to detect changes (default is "text" - recommended for most users):

- **Text Mode** ⭐ (Recommended)
  - Watches the actual words on the page
  - Ignores design changes, ads, and timestamps
  - Perfect for: prices, availability, news articles

- **HTML Mode**
  - Watches everything including page structure
  - Detects even tiny changes
  - Perfect for: complete page monitoring

- **Hash Mode**
  - Super fast checking
  - Detects any change at all
  - Perfect for: frequent checks, simple pages

### Check Interval

How often to check the website:
- **Quick checks**: 5-10 seconds (careful - don't overload websites!)
- **Normal**: 60 seconds (1 minute) - good default
- **Relaxed**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) or more

**Tip**: Start with 60 seconds and adjust based on how often the site changes.

### CSS Selectors (Advanced)

Want to watch just part of a page? Use CSS selectors:
- **Leave empty** - Watch the whole page (easiest!)
- **`#price`** - Watch the price element
- **`.stock-status`** - Watch stock availability
- **`h1.title`** - Watch the page title

**Don't know CSS?** No problem! Just leave it empty to watch everything.

1. Click "Browse" next to Alert Sound
2. Pick your own WAV sound file
3. Or leave default for the built-in alert
