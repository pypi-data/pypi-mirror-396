"""
Example 2: Multi-Model Consensus (Quorum Sensing Topology)
==========================================================

Demonstrates the Quorum Sensing pattern where multiple agents vote
on a decision. Action is only taken when the "concentration" of
agreement exceeds a threshold.

This mirrors how bacteria coordinate behavior - individual signals
are weak and noisy, but collective agreement produces robust action.

Topology:
    Request --> [Agent 1] --\
            --> [Agent 2] ---+--> [Vote Counter] --> (threshold?) --> Action
            --> [Agent 3] --/
            --> [Agent N] -/
